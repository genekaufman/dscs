But back to the on-point-former-sewing-machine-cover. I ended up needing to trim it quite a bit and add borders in order to square it up, but I think I like it even more bordered than without. I think it will eventually become a mini wall-hanging, probably to be hung near my sewing machine.

While Forest City Ratner says it owns or controls 90 percent of the project site, that percentage is a bit misleading; of ten buildings that still contain rental tenants, six are owned by the developer. Even though those six buildings are counted in the 90 percent, FCR has not yet gotten tenants in those buildings to move.

I'm turning 37 this Friday (May 18th)!
So, having said that where does it leave us? Well, if we take a look at the top three in the event Bolt was 10.02 the season before his breakout year (9.69 the following year); Gay was 10.06 the season before his breakout year (9.84 the following year); and Powell was 10.02 the season before his breakout year (9.87 the following year). So any of these guys could potentially be the one. If I were going to say who I thought had the best chance it would have to be Dix, Williams and Bailey. They have the best overall set of skills to make that move to the next level. Gatlin is the elephant in the room – the guy that could change everything.
I found the whole story at the dating agency was really entertaining, and I enjoyed reading about Amy's matches, both good and bad as the book went on. You could sort of anticipate whether it'd be a good date for Amy or not by the lead up and way the person was discussed, but that didn't spoil my enjoyment of the book. I had a bit of a soft spot for Christopher, the owner of the dating agency, Amy just pretty much ignored him aside from when he was useful to her and I felt sorry for him as I could read between the lines a bit. Amy herself was a fun character, I do have to question her morals a bit because a few of the things she did in the book I found a bit questionable and seemed out of the blue, but in her more normal moments, Amy was great. I can't confess to knowing a great deal more about star signs and compataiblity now I've read the book, but there is enough in there about to keep you going as you read, and it's fun to read about astrology as the book goes on too.
I want to be “lit up” always! I don’t want to be sad. Or angry. I don’t want to be an energy drainer. I want to strengthen and grow with those around me. I want to encourage, not depress.

My list of thankfulness has to start with God. I am beyond thankful and in awe that He has allowed me to have the life I do. "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me, Philippians 4:13" is a verse that comes to mind often. This life I get to lead is not because of me, it's in spite of me far too often. God keeps letting me screw up and still keep moving forward despite my shortcomings.

I have an excuse, of course I do - my parents have been visiting and I've been busy showing off my current home town to them - but they left today and now... Well, now it's back to reality.

The Tales series has always had interesting cast of characters and story that kept me coming back to play the series. I can’t even count the number of games that I’ve played from this series, and that just goes to show how appealing this series is.

I guess it shouldn’t surprise me in the way geese fight, having inadvertently gotten too close to goose nests at times while paddling, I know that they use every available weapon they have to wage war on an intruder. They will slam into you, beat you with their wings, claw you with their feet, and bite you with their bill, which alone is enough to make you wish you had paid more attention in the first place.

There are two little drawers full of fused scraps in my studio. To begin I created a pieced background with 5 irregular strips of dark fabrics. From my stash I pulled out a gray, dark print, blue, red and green fabrics of a similar dark value, pieced them together. This is not an attractive background but it is interesting.
It gets pretty tiring being a public figure, but I figure putting on a show for the cameras is the least I can do for you little people.
Next, break apart each empanada disc and individually lay them out (but don’t pull them apart if they’re not well-thawed).
If I sound like I’m being overly harsh on a show that never marketed itself as being anything other than a primetime soap, I make no apologies. There are far better shows out there playing that game. What made Ringer infuriating was its insistence on insulting its audience with in-episode flashbacks, and characters so stupid it made it seem like the entirety of Lower Manhattan was experiencing carbon monoxide poisoning (if one more person, apropos of nothing, reminds Bridget of things Siobhan regularly does or doesn’t do I’ll kill her myself). If you’re going to earn yourself a reputation as a place where crazy plots reside, at least commit to the bit – have those bitches meet in episode seven, do a game-change in a mid-season finale, and dispatch one or more of the leads in the finale. Don’t whimper over the finish line by coasting on a mystery that you insist on not solving.
I received Year One of the two year curriculum, which included the teacher's edition and student text. Retail price for one year of Write with WORLD is $95., or both year one and two for $165; this also includes a year's worth of online support in the form of examples, writing prompts, and an online teachers forum for each year of curriculum purchased. It also offers your student a chance to be published on the site. Because the online support site is not yet live, I didn't get the chance to check it out, so I cannot say what-all will be available on the site.

There are several humor stories that have been the best-selling books for a long time in the market. A plethora of new writers and the contemporary style of scripts have been gaining enough recognition which aims to offer fresh and subtle humor. In fact, these days the culmination of mystery & humor stories is being liked by immensely by the readers. Also, the write-ups that depict love and compassion are famous among readers. Books based on romance stories have beautiful moments which are extremely interesting and keeps the readers engrossed till the end. Fiction stories are undoubtedly one of the most suitable ways to spend time and acquire interesting thoughts for people all over the world.

Think about it: if the gender roles had been ordained by God, and, indeed, encoded right into the nature of boys and girls (as any competent God really ought to have done), then surely it shouldn’t matter how a child is brought-up; if males are ordained by nature towards masculinity*, then what bloody difference would parenting (which is, of course, a social factor) make? May I conclude, selon the pastor, that if I dress my (hypothetical) son up as a pretty pink fairy princess and call him by some girly name that he will grow-up to be a transwoman?

And, while we're at it, thanks for nothing, Microsoft. Nigerian scammers have had control of my email account for FOUR days. A simple look at the activity on the account (changed password, changed verification secondary email addresses, loads of email traffic outbound, contact exported, etc etc) would surely register as suspicious enough to at least lock the account temporarily.

Now people ask how do we fix this? The wealthy and those who have not fallen off of the employment wagon say there is no problem. Those that say that either have no heart or do not care about fellow humans or are undereducated. This how I would fix it. I would tax or charge corporations fees for sending jobs to other countries, instead of giving tax beaks for shipping jobs overseas like they are getting now. I would also make it a law that the C.E.O.’s can not own stock, that way they do not make decisions for their own gains. Instead of bonuses for the management I would implement a law that would only allow profit-sharing for all the workers, from the janitor to the president. Do not think this is wealth distribution, heck it’s the people under management who make the companies the goods to sell for profit.

I sent her a final email asking her politely what part of the spectrum of Christianity her behaviour belonged in. I also said I wasn't angry, just disappointed with that behaviour. I said, too, that I wanted to continue to think well of her and was there any thing she could say that would help me to do that. That was back in May and I have not heard a word from her since.

When he gets near the top, there is a helicopter waiting for him but Jonah locks down the throttle, jumps from the bike and watches as the bike top the hill, becomes airborne and smashes into the chopper.

The whole shooting match explodes as Jonah climbs down the side of the coaster track.

I have been following the lobby groups and online petitions and letters to anybody who cares in the lead up to the sale and was fascinated by the loyalty shown to the brand. And the angst in the weeks since the sale shows just how parochial some drinkers can be about ‘their brew’ and how immune to the realities of business they can be at the same time.

Long ago when I was a teenager, I occasionally accompanied a relative of mine on journeys to do with his business, taking the opportunity to discover bits of the country I’d not normally have known about in the process. One regular trip was to Loughborough, and the last leg was up the A6 from Leicester. We didn’t have much time for places like Mountsorrel, a small town on the A6 that I remember as being full of grime, noise, and fumes from the cars and lorries on the main road, which carved its way straight through the centre. ‘A decayed market town,’ Pevsner called it, and no wonder. And as for the church. Well, who would bother to pay attention to a building so pulled about, patched up with brick, apparently unloved, its walls of local granite graying over with dust? Added to which, it

But not all initiates make it into the Dauntless faction. Only the bravest. Only the strongest. Only the best. Readers follow Tris (Beatrice) on her new journey. We meet fellow initiates--those born Dauntless, and those transferring from other factions. We follow their training through three stages. They will be challenged physically, mentally, and emotionally. We become familiar with their two trainers--Eric and Four. We see the faction's strengths and weaknesses. As does Tris. On the one hand, Tris realizes she is fierce. She can be strong, determined, brave. She is learning to face her fears, learning to face life. But she's also realizing that compassion and love are part of courage. That selflessness has prepared her for her new life. On the other hand, she sees how heartless, how cruel some are. Yes, the Dauntless have their flaws.
The Koch Theater stacks high – two, three, four levels. During the technical rehearsal, the director coached her to sing to the people in the last row on the last tier. And she did just that! A wee little thing she is (maybe five feet tall, no more than 90 lbs), she stood center stage and shared her story of Kamlari, or indentured servitude, through this song.
Cling On is a light green metallic shade that is more on the grassy side. It looks slightly different depending on the light so I included a bunch of photos with different light settings. It's pretty sheer but I managed to get it opaque in 2 coats. I used all the China Glaze magnets on different fingers for a bit of variation. It applied like butter and dried very fast, which is always a plus with metallic polishes.

We’ll have faith because we’re clean — not just because of what Jesus did — but because we lived in Him, righteous, by His grace we overcame. We didn’t shrink back. We made sure that we stayed right with Him. We’re supposed to walk like Jesus walked. We can’t just do our own thing and think it’s okay because of some formula. “Without holiness, no man will see God.”
Information in hand, I marched back to my house to retrieve my friend (who hadn't been informed of the situation) chuck some handy supplies in a bag (torch, candles, water, mozzie repellant, first aid kit) and then retreated to higher ground. Soon everyone had gathered. As a very small place, more of a retreat than a resort, there were only about 20 guests and we hunkered down with the staff on a rustic bare-board platform perched on top of the jungle clad hill. This was where, the cooks told us, villagers spent days after the 2004 tsunami that had wiped out their homes, tying themselves to trees to prevent their families being washed away.

So, my new resolve to run actually started before I penned this blog, near the end of November, but it wasn't until January that I started to take it seriously. Our training strategy was to be able to run 10 minutes straight with one-minute rest (walking) periods. Luckily, we are well-matched in terms of pace, so we were able to begin at four minute intervals, followed by five and then six. We are allowed to move on once we achieve a minimum of six repetitions of the interval. I thought that the five-minute intervals would be the death of our running careers, but, luckily we have made it through to six minutes. Aside from the occasional trumpeting coming out of my backside, my IBS has not been too bad. We have had times when I was required to do longer walking intervals in order to ward off bathroom sessions, but, no real emergency situations occurred until last week. During our last run I had to abandon ship after only two and a half sets of six minutes. I did not feel that our friendship was strong enough for me to soil myself in front of him. I was extremely frustrated and disappointed as we felt ready to tackle the six-minute interval hurdle, but, that was not to be. It was a miracle that I made it to the washroom in time.
A little bit about her: she loves spending time playing in the dirt with kids and eating delicious fresh veggies. Outside of work she spends her time riding her bike, sewing, reading about alternative economics, and trying to make new friends.
One of the best pieces of advice I've ever applied to all of my go-kits is simply a bar of soap, a wash cloth and a hand towel. A Steward (which is more applicable than 'flight attendent')I knew who worked aboard a billionaires private jet remarked that "hot soapy water, a nice soft towel and a clean face and new shirt can literally change your mental ability to work a 20+ hour day". He is very very right. I consider just as important as my night scope to be honest.

(Where's the "cure" you ask? If that's the main reason you haven't been making jerky, well, come on down! I hate sodium nitrite. Imagine my surprise when at my Master Food Preserver Class, Barbara Ingham, Wisconsin's Extension food scientist and our teacher, said I didn't have to use it! There was a catch. Without cure in it, you will store it in the refrigerator. If you are going on a camping trip, etc., it will keep for 2 weeks out of the refrigerator, but not indefinitely. This more than covers me for a day long shopping trip, or Rick for a day of pheasant hunting.)
You see, even without coding skills, I can pull back the curtain for you – give you some lists that will evoke those names that will “feel” right to you. In doing so I am deeply indebted to Wikipedia for its general awesomeness. Remember, when proper names are used, Star Trek ships generally have only utilized the persons last name (USS Yeager, USS Kelvin), though sometimes a full name is used (USS Thomas Paine). EVE ships of course, using the full name or not is up to you.

There are so many varieties in pongal like milaku pongal, kalyana pongal, rava pongal, aval pongal etc. But, adding keerai varieties like palak, murungaikeerai, and mulaikkeerai to the pongal always enhance the taste tremendously. Especially drumstick leaves happen to give a delicious taste with tamarind and a little spices as side ingredients. Hope every one likes this.

The Mullan chap served a deserved 10 game ban because he broke Mr. Zakuani’s leg. I’m pretty sure that when he comes back to the field of play after the suspension he’ll feel like Michael Jackson’s American in Paris because he has been out of the game for 2-3 months at least.
This company offers so many credits per year depending on how many you buy. Obviously the more you buy, the more vacations you can go on. They started out offering a $25,000 time share. After saying no a million times they finally went down in price to their "starter" package that was $8,700 for 7,500 credits. That equals about two weeks of vacation per year if you book 30 days or less from departure. After thinking about buying, I called Ryan's stepmom who owns a time share. Within two minutes of calling her, I was talked out of doing it. Ryan still wanted to do it and we were told we could cancel the contract within 5 business days (we were shown that in writting before signing anything). So we said yes because we wanted to find out more and look more into what it is really about. Our sales person was beyond excited and started telling us how much fun we were going to have, how to get the most of our vacations, what a good deal it is, blah blah blah.

Nicholas D. Kristof in his NYT article: “The furor over Greg’s work breaks my heart. And the greatest loss will be felt not by those of us whose hero is discredited, nor even by Greg himself, but by countless children in Afghanistan who now won’t get an education after all. But let’s not forget that even if all the allegations turn out to be true, Greg has still built more schools and transformed more children’s lives than you or I ever will.
The flip side of this success story is that “Homefield” is not just the first short story I ever published, it’s also the last. About a month before the acceptance letter came I had given up writing fiction as a waste of time. By the time the letter came, I’d had a month for discouragement and laziness to set in and that was that. I’m rather ashamed of throwing in the towel, but there it is.

At one point, the patient's heart converted to an arhythmic condition which impacted his blood pressure. We gave an arythmia medication to try to break him out, but it didn't work. We moved on to synchronized cardioversion where we attempt to shock the heart back into a regular rhythm, but that too failed. Still, we kept the blood pressure up, the pulses intact, and the oxygenation status good. In the morning, the attending physician - a notoriously critical doc - actually told me and my partner nurse, "Good job." Could have knocked us over with a feather.

Anyway, a friend gave him a Leinie sampler 12-pack, and he wanted to share the wealth. I thanked him, and left the four beers in the garage to chill. Last night I pulled out the Fireside Nut Brown and popped it. Whoa! Now I know what the "Natural flavor added" bit on the label means: they put hazelnut essence in here. That's going to make it hard for me to like this one, I just don't like hazelnuts, except for out of hand eating and in pastries. Not in coffee, not in beer. Not this one, not Rogue, not whatever. I liked the pecans in the Shiner Holiday Cheer, but hazelnut...yeesh.

"Perhaps also for a dyslexic musician who plays extremely well it is very burdensome to then have to go back and look at the music: it creates anxiety.

In a tall glass, crack 1 egg and pour in as much milk as you like. Whisk in some sugar, salt, and vanilla extract. Now, begin adding flour 2 tbsp at a time until you get the desired consistency: it should be pour-able but not too runny. Make sure not to over mix.
Your portrait can be of a friend, family member, or yourself and we will have different drawing materials for you to choose from. We encourage you beforehand to see works from the exhibition–look at the different points of view artists use, the way their subjects are posed, their facial expressions, etc. What feeling do you get from these portraits? If you are looking at a black and white portrait, how would it feel differently if it had been done in color, and vice versa?
Unlike much of the rest of my life, class offers me a safe place to “fail” — to try something new, to do it poorly, to take gentle and helpful instruction, to go away and think hard about why I couldn’t even see clearly that which was before my eyes for so long. My fellow students are planning to show their work soon, but I’m in no rush to join them. I don’t need or want that validation — or that pressure to do it right or well or good enough.

I dont have any good pics from the concert they are on cell phones....I am probably going to end up posting what we do have on facebook though or stealing Gina's pics LOL Other than that the concert was definitely an experiencing with the rain, the crowd surfing, the flashing, the herbal remedies, the trash, and did I mention chili? I ended up with a lovely sunburn due to forgetting my sunscreen at home but Gina chased down an older couple and they hooked me up with some ancient sunscreen which I hope minimized some of the further damage. overall an interesting time and to you parents with teenagers at the concert kudos to you for taking your kids to something you probably hated - I can only hope I am that cool in a few years, although I fear my eldest will be one of the first to hop in for the crowd surfing!

Happy weekend friends! Today I'm driving down to Miami to see my mom, my brother and my grandma that are visiting from Colombia. I can't wait to be there! But before I leave, I'll like to share a card I made for my mom. She is crazy about shopping!
Marlene: What kind of research did you have to do for this story?
Yet a rich soil is full of goodness. Just see how a little seed grows!
Jeff Shelton's at it again. Perennial site favorite The Well Wishers are due for another new album. It's called Dreaming of the West Coast (where else?), and should be out by year's end.
Anyways, this is just super rambling and not exciting (almost as not exciting as reading about me working all the time). So...
The cover and info on this fortnight's edition of Doctor Who Monster Invasion magazine:
The place I want to be more than anything is my home. Even Ju Ju tells me we should move back to Hawaii because she loves food there (LOL) and I can be close to my mom and sisiter. She tells me it's okay to say goodbye to her friends because she knows that's where we are be the happiest... But right now, I take the second best place - Florida.... I'm just not ready to lose what I have come to love. Again. Family is important. No doubt about it. But I'm just not ready to feel the sadness of saying goodbye to all the people I call my friends and famly now. I did that six years ago and I'm too scared to do it again... Am I being selfish? I don't know..
* Might it be that what really ruffled feathers here was a very pertinent dig at a very silly idea? ‘Fab City’?! That wouldn’t come from the same bright spark who thought ‘Cool Britannia’ was a winner, by any chance?
Think “Pet rocks”, “Mood rings”, and the “Veg-O-matic”.
Are we experimented awkward silences? What about when there is nothing else to say in the middle of a conversation or we think we already finish it, or by mutual agreement we need to move on. Perhaps, the most interesting silences are the ones linked with social interaction, where human beings assume a social comprehension of others and their surroundings by senses such as the speech or the body language. Audience : Hearing is a sound installation that invites spectators to bring their own silences to the exhibition space. What follows is a variety of silences collected (a hundred of them) mixed-up with new participants during the event. It keeps proximity with 4’33” of John Cage, in spite of that, the angle offered is closer to real life situations than to a theatrical sound art piece.
It's past midnight, friends, and it feels like a perfectly ghoulish time for some good old-fashioned ghost stories. We have monsters, creeps, and spirits on the brain today due to earlier posts, so we might as well carry on with another voyage... to the Other Side.
It is strange to listen to people from the Left in Norway, many of whom are diehard anti-Semites, i.e. people who despise people for no other reason than their ethnicity, criticise individuals, in this case anti-Islamists, who speak out against a religion that rejects the notion of civil liberties, encourages the killing of Jews and Christians, and mandates the introduction of global fascism.

The post I wrote in 2010...
Several Sundays ago, (on Palm Sunday to be exact), I decided to take a few pictures of the “new me.” Well maybe not the new me, but the lessened me. I realized I hadn’t taken any full body pictures of myself for awhile, so that Sunday, I decided to set up the camera and take a few.
I have allowed myself too much traipsing about in the wastelands of social commentary. I have allowed myself to be entangled far too deeply in the small-mindedness of consumer culture and politics. Politics in particular. Election years in specific tend to be time-sumps, and with the "facilitator of dreams" that is electronic media, the sump is in danger of becoming all-consuming.
After the course is finished, I am hoping that I will be able to work at the dive shop. I’m hoping that my existing connection with the shop owner and the staff will be enough to land me some work. I haven’t recieved any promised though and my guess is that I’ll only be making around $10 an hour. So I’m on the hunt for a sitter that will work for less than that, and that won’t be easy to find. The big thing I plan to use as leverage is that there are no diapers to change since my kids are a bit older.
Okay, you ready for this? At 3:00 this afternoon I told my boss a story. I had to leave early to go take care of my nephew. Oh, not because of anything to do with him. Except in my story. See, he had a doctor appointment today for shots and regular baby-type stuff (passed with flying colors, I might add). BUT, with my twisted little brain, I changed that up into my SISTER having a doctor appointment MUCH later in the afternoon and ME having to go keep an eye on HIM until she got back. Got out 45 minutes early, I did. Yeah, looks like I may never learn. But hell, what was I supposed to tell my boss? Is it really a better idea to go in there and say to her I-can't-take-it-another-minute I-have-to-get-out-of-here before-somebody-gets-hurt?

2. Gina Carano in “Haywire” – Many movie reviewers have been upset by the heavy beatdown Carano’s character takes in the new Soderbergh film, “Haywire”. When she first gets hit hard, it is a little jarring, but afterward (spoiler alert) she puts a bad hurting on Channing Tatum (he had it coming!) and it’s girl-power all the way! I was amazed at Carano’s physical skills during this film, reminding me of a much prettier, young Jackie Chan and like Lara Croft without the gadgets and fantasy. I would like to see more of this female spy character.

I like it better because it means your cabbages are not overly pesticide.
Still, some of my quibbles can reasonably be seen as those of a fan who would never be completely happy with any adaptation. My main point is, if your on the fence because of the negative press, you shouldn't be.
Kelly rolled Vickie over when Jack Swagger came out and confronted with Dolph Ziggler.
After having a breast reduction in February of 2000, I quit smoking again. I was doing some working out and eating better at first. I think I got down again to about 145 pounds, if I recall correctly. The man that is now my husband and I started dating that summer. My confidence and energy levels were through the roof and I felt wonderful.

I think part of the reason I love taking photos of people is that some of them absolutely fascinate me. So many worlds to be exposed to.

Real stories about children that were not in control of their lives.
Why is this of note? Because James Rondeau is the Frances and Thomas Dittmer Curator of Contemporary Art at the Art Institute of Chicago.

On many occasions you have publicly stated that the diversity of New York City is our greatest strength, yet your words ring hollow, as we examine the lack of diversity within your administration. Furthermore, there is a complete omission of African American men in charge of any high level agency. You have four high level vacancies that deal predominantly with people of color. You now have an obligation to ensure that those positions be filled by individuals who represent the people those agencies serve.

Another thing I love about this recipe is that the cream is not cream, but creme fraiche. Makes me feel so virtuous. I took this recipe from BBC good food and edited the proportions somewhat.

12. Remove all cellphones, facebook pages etc. Be firm, don’t give into emotional blackmail. They might say they hate you, underneath they’ll appreciate the break. But have their friends around more often. Have homework dates for older children. Play board games rather than computer games. Put the time in, but be childish – pull pranks, trick them, have them on. For older children, including teens, pull out their old lego and dolls and see what happens.
Everything is gestation and bringing forth. To let each impression and each germ of a feeling come to completion wholly in itself, in the dark, in the inexpressible, the unconscious, beyond the reach of one’s own intelligence, and await with deep humility and patience the birth-hour of a new clarity: that alone is living in the artist’s life. –Rainer Maria Rilke
Things changed, as we all know, and while Yuengling is still only in fourteen states, they announced today that thanks largely to the huge surge in sales from their Ohio launch last year, they are now the largest American-owned brewery. Think on that, ye mighty, and despair.

"Why did Wash have to die?" ("Because Joss said" is not an acceptable answer.)
Polychronic cultures, on the other hand, like to multi-task and are generally less stringent when it comes to establishing or following an agenda. In this setting, the concept of time is more fluid, and the pace of life is more relaxed.
The irony was hardly lost on me. That happened to be my father’s specialty and almost exclusive area of practice. Years back, eye doctors in Charlotte sent their patients fifty miles north to the little town of Shelby to see the country eye doctor who just happened to have studied at Johns Hopkins and had a national reputation.
Suggestions of what can be in the catechist training:
Balla was best known as leader of the wonderful Guinean orhestra from the Syliphone era Balla et ses Balladins. Born in Macenta, he started his career as a musician in Kankan and subsequently was sent to the Dakar conservatoire (musical college) on a scholarship. In 1959 he joined the Syli Orchestre National, where his talent, not just as a trumpet player, but also a leader, caught the eye of the authorities of the young republic. When the Syli orchestre was split up, he was put in charge of one of the sections. This section played at the Jardin de Guinée, a bar dancing, which I am told exists until this day.
Quite simply, Idaho is refusing to treat wolves as wildlife — pursuing a path of targeting wolves as vermin, using troubling tactics:
All Glee is these days is a glorified radio station. They just sing songs on the show because they are what's hip in music today. Not all the songs, no...but most. In season one, the songs had deep meaning to the characters singing them. They were usually always relevant to the story. Now it's just a cheap gimmick to promote popular songs and virtually have no relevance to the overall story of the episode. I don't care about any of the characters anymore. Even Sue Sylvester is incredibly dull now. She used to be the funniest character on TV...now we are lucky if she has one funny line an episode...or if she's even an episode at all. Her shtick just seems so forced now and tiresome. I feel bad for Jane Lynch, because she's great at what she does, but the writing has become dismal.
Betsy asked if Michael had a message for me. “She worries too much,” I heard myself say, in an offhand, curt tone. “Relax. I’ll take care of it.”

Why is it that when you start trying for a baby sex becomes different? I noticed this the first night of sex when we started trying. It felt like a mission. It wasn’t just sex, it was sex with the possibility of feeling failure afterwards. It almost feels like that once you start trying for a baby all the passion and lustful sex thoughts are taken out of the equation and the only thing you can think about is, is this gonna make a baby. And maybe these feelings are just me. But I also think there is a way to fix this. I think I really just need to get out of my head, stop worrying, and just enjoy my husband.
And the final season of ER goes out as it came in 15 seasons before — with an electrifying mix of complex characters, rich storylines, brisk pacing and kinetic style. Favorite characters from the past (some you expect, some may surprise you) return in this 22-episode valedictory season of the series that shattered the mold for medical dramas. You’ve come to the right place. Check in one last, momentous time at County General.

A big hello to all my friends in Blogland! It's Marie here and I am excited to share with you a Design Team card i created for ICopic Lover. I selected an adorable stamp called Mermaid Marci by La-La Land Crafts. The size of this stan makes it perfect for cards or projects and the size is large enough that it makes it fun and easy to color with those Copic Markers!

On Saturday at 15.30, from the Cathedral towards the Friedhof am Perlacher Forst, the clergy led a large procession to the graves of Alexander’s friends, the brother and sister Hans and Sophie Scholl, and Christoph Probst, executed in February 1943. They honoured the memory of prayer and a moment of silence. Then, the participants in this out-of-the-ordinary and rare phenomenon, the making of a saint from a mere mortal man, trudged through the snow-covered cemetery to the grave of Alexander Schmorell. Despite the bitter cold, the priests served a litiya, and, then, the marchers returned to the cathedral for the last Pannikhida for Alexander before his glorification. After the Vigil service, the clergy brought out the icon of the new saint and they sang the service to the new saint before it.

I ordered this for myself, Vietnamese Rice Vermicelli with a pot of sour spicy soup over a hot mini stove, with fresh prawns, celery, tomatoes and bean sprouts. Nothing special about this main dish, quite ordinary, I still prefer the appetizers!
“Ummm... What just happened?” I ask, with marked confusion.
Consciousness, Presence, All That Is, is not static; it is the infinite field of pure potentiality, the possibility of everything; spilling over, pouring itself out in pure Being, the beingness of everything in pure Love, the Love which everything is.

To paraphrase Tony Stark (because I can’t find the quote on Google), Tom Hiddleston is everything America expects an English villain to be. He a camp, over-the-top diva who is utterly evil and wants nothing more than the downfall of the United States (and, as a result, the world). Surprisingly, this is not a criticism. Loki camps it up as an immortal, power-hungry monster as only an ancient god can. As a man with huge power, a thirst for revenge and (as he sees it) a divine and immutable right to rule the world, there is no other way to play it than scene-chewingly angry. He faces every challenge with a curved lip or victorious smile. I loved every second he was on-screen. Even more so once defeat becomes inevitable.
and that maybe something I did or something I said,
We are officially at the point in the deployment that I miss my husband. Not that I haven’t missed him the whole time he’s been gone. But this is different. It is total, complete missing him, there is nothing I can do that I don’t miss him.
I'm ridiculously pleased with this card - I just love the rich purples and I'm delighted with the bow! Aaaah, small things. But it works so well together and, strangely, I hadn't really anything in mind when I set out to colour this one. It just sometimes works that way, doesn't it - a happy accident, almost.

Start by answering the following question:
Even as the Treyvon Martin case saturates the airwaves, why is Corporate American Media concurrently failing to report what Russia Today has, that 2 American aircraft carrier task forces and 2 Marine amphibious assault groups have been deployed in the Persian Gulf region for reasons obvious? And that a third American aircraft carrier task force is due to join them in another month? And that thousands of American troops are being deployed to Israel? Why does the average American of any skin color not know of the utilization of the terrorist Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK/PMOI) by the Israeli Mossad and the Neo-Conservative wing of the American intelligence community for criminal actions in Iran, including the assassination of 5 Iranian nuclear scientists and what the Washington Post terms an “unexplained” 5-fold increase in explosions and bomb blasts in that country in the last two years, especially in Iranian Azerbaijan, Khuzestan province, and Balochistan province? And why has the cogent analysis of Pepe Escobar on the American Imperial Wars in Central Asia escaped coverage by Wolf Blitzer and Dana Bash of CNN, and Sean Hannity of Fox?

In the Carribean and South America, successive waves of second sons of the Spanish and Portuguese dons (and other exiles) created vast sugar plantations, a slave-based extractive economy that would allow them to return home wealthy. Many never intended to stay.

The couple from All About Afternoon Tea are lovely Brits who have lived here for almost a year and they are extreme foodies. They take their white chocolate mousse cake very seriously. Becca also takes very seriously the fact that her mother in law was visiting, and the shoot was on the last day of the visit. It is rather a wonder that they were able to work with her perched five feet away in a lawn chair, fussing. I'm pretty sure all the table planning that Becca and I did in advance was directly related to the amount of time she had to escape the house for the previous two weeks. Of course, I thought it was so wonderful that she was so keen :)
I've managed to reproduce an image of three quarters of the trade label using digital reconstruction, and this is enough to show that it was for A. & G. Taylor's branch studio at 63 London Road, Derby, operated by managing partner William Middleton, who also controlled branches in Sheffield, Nottingham, Goole, Doncaster and Barnsley. Although not definitive proof that the opalotype was made there, in conjunction with the negative number of presumed Derby origin ("Derb 22468"), one could certainly make a strong case for it.
Today's mail is SUPER exciting because not only did I get a card back that I thought was long gone, but he's a Royals prospect that is in camp with the big league team as we speak! I sent this around opening day last year, and received it back today (postmarked AZ)! Good luck in ST Derrick!!!

But please don’t interfere with how I go about it!
This typical school-book pick never goes out of style. Though it was written in 1847, the language is easy to follow and the story is full of action and drama, much easier to read for a young person than some more slow-moving classics of the time. With free copies of the book online and often pre-downloaded on eReaders, there’s no excuse to not read this classic.
Grandparents should also have rights of access after separation, but where possible to have access to coincide with the Parents Contact, but above all to be there to show support, stability and continuity to very young children.

In a desperate attempt to get out of debt, I go back into the private sector, pursue some interesting investments in a high-tech firm, and... well, long story short -- I've integrated my consciousness into a massive, superintelligent computer system that crushes humanity and rules the world.

Routinely, hospitals encourage families to have the hospital nursery staff bathe their baby within 2-4 hours after birth to 'decontaminate baby' from the messiness of birth.
That’s where my hero comes into the picture. It was 10:50 pm last night when I desperately emailed my always very helpful blogging friend, Gary, to see if he could help me with my blogging emergency. Within seconds he replied, telling me to call him. I felt really bad calling him so late at night, but he didn’t mind at all. He talked me through resizing my images to a more appropriate size for the internet and also how to delete the large images from my old posts and reinsert smaller versions. This way I can gain back my free space.
Happy C.

One of the last adorable Gussie traits to gush about is his very expressive eye brows and ears. Visualize Gromit of Wallace and Gromit. The ears I swear are on ball bearings. They can swivel so quickly and move in such odd positions, it’s uncanine at times. The eye brows can rise and arch so high, the eyes almost look like they have migrated to the top of his head. I liken his eyes to the Puss-in-Boots character in the Shrek movies. You know, when the Puss plays on the awe-what a cute-puddy-tat appeal to get his way. When it’s time for Gus to go to his own bed because it’s night time, he just about breaks my heart. His ears droop practically to his knees (and they are short ears), the brows migrate to the top of his head and the eyes become huge limpid pools of sorrow. He’ll then ooze of the bed with a kathump onto the floor and walk slowly out of our bedroom, glancing a few times at us as he walks out, head hanging resignedly down almost scraping the floor. If my dog could speak human, he’d say, “it’s alright, I don’t mind, I can move, if I have to, I guess.” Who woulda thought, my dog is related to Red Green of the Red Greed Show (eh?)

Since it was Friday, I'd planned to roast a chicken (that way, we can enjoy sandwiches and salad all weekend). Most cooks have a basic recipe for chicken. It's the little black dress of poultry: classic, versatile, and works for all menus and occasions. Roasted chicken can be dressed up or down--the accessories are endless, down-home vegetables or exotic ingredients.

Bad Kids – Black Lips
1. Give up your need to always be right. There are so many of us who can’t stand the idea of being wrong – wanting to always be right – even at the risk of ending great relationships or causing a great deal of stress and pain, for us and for others. It’s just not worth it. Whenever you feel the ‘urgent’ need to jump into a fight over who is right and who is wrong, ask yourself this question: “Would I rather be right, or would I rather be kind?” Wayne Dyer. What difference will that make? Is your ego really that big?

I started to morph from the sporty tomboy of freshman year (to this day people know me as the chick with the baseball caps) to a young woman who wasn’t as extreme as the pseudo model co-eds, but was developing what I thought in my mind, a more mature look. To truly achieve this, to truly become my more feminine and mature self, it was clear, my all-purpose athletic shoes had to be the first to go.

At the diner, Caroline thinks she may have gotten herpes from the lip gloss. Sophie comes by and Max tells Caroline she invited her for a free meal so they could work things out. Sophie compliments the girls’ outfits, tells them the food is horrible, and says she’ll take them to a nicer place tomorrow. She also mentions that all the girls in her apartment worked for her. At the restaurant, Sophie notes that the waiters there make $300-350 a night and Caroline tells her they only make $60-80. Sophie asks them how they expect to accomplish their cupcake business with so little money. She then takes out a model of the house she’s having built in Poland. She says she keeps it around to remember where she’s going.

The receptionist called her to see the counselor in the examination room.

I’ll be going over the procedure with you and address any concerns you might have about it.” She sat at the table in the middle of the room. “Now before we begin, we just want to check that you’re sure of your decision.”

Combine this with a collapse of our electricity supply network and massive problems relating to our water supply, followed by a total collapse of our currency (the SA Rand) and you have a recipe for anarchy, genocide, famine, and human self-preservation instincts.

First beer of the night is Wentworth brewerys Bumble beer. The brewery describes this beer as 'a golden honeyed ale using 4 different local honeys to make a distinctive and ever changing ale with rounded flavours. What this means i have no idea but im a big fan of honey ales so looking forward to opening. Right well no head to start with no matter how the pour is done, the smells however are great (if you like honey) you can really notice the honey on the nose that some people may say is a little too heavy but personally this is the first I've found that gives a nice big punch, aside from this theres a small hint of hops on the side that is noticeable but not till the end. A fairly sweet beer, i'd say this would be a beer for someone starting on ale as it's sweet and theres very little to hate about it but unfortunately at this point for me theres little to really find in terms of depth of flavour at this point. Over all simple, sweet and very pale. Not amazing but worth a try and could be interesting to compare at different times if the year for the different subtle honey tastes.
Community is about an eccentric Spanish study group at the small (and fictional) Greendale Community College in Colorado. Jeff Winger (The Soup‘s Joel McHale) is a former attorney who has been disbarred for faking his schooling and so he’s attending community college in order to get his life back. He finds himself immediately attracted to the feminist Britta (Choke‘s Gillian Jacobs) in his Spanish class (taught by The Hangover‘s Ken Jeong). Jeff founds a Spanish study group to at first get closer to Britta, but he eventually strikes up an unexpected friendship as the leader of a group of ragtag misfits all trying to survive the surreal landscape that is Greendale. With a group consisting of the Asperger’s suffering pop-culture fanatic Abed (Danny Pudi), the former jock and sensitive idiot Troy (Donald Glover), the racist, homophobic, and obnoxious Pierce (Chevy Chase), the virginal and shy ex-Ritalin addict Annie (Mad Men‘s Alison Brie), and the single black mother Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown), there’s bound to be conflict and personal crisis, but when they learn to stick together and care for each other, this study group becomes its own little family.

We have an internal thermometer that when we go above our level of comfort we can’t take the heat so we find a way back down to our preset comfort level. It works the other way too, if we fall below that comfort level we find a way to get back up to it. When we achieve a greater level of success than we are used to we find it hard to handle, however if we fall below our standard then we find a way to get back to our comfort zone.
When I traveled on the art show circuit, many of my customers would stand for long periods of time reading the stories I had attached to each sculpture. Some of the stories brought tears to their eyes; others, smiles of knowing to their faces. At the prompting of those customers – "We can't afford to buy all your sculpture to get the stories" – I decided to self-publish She Who Whispers. But I needed the expertise to pull it all together. A book called "How to Publish Your Own Book," by Dan Poyntner, showed me the way. I highly recommend it. This book removed any reservations I had about self-publishing: I was so excited. That was in 1990 and She Who Whispers is still selling extremely well.

With manga, I will forgive a lot of the art missteps and rough-around-the-edgesness that a lot of newer artists or lesser known groups make. After all, I’m more of a lyrics girl. Breathtaking art and pretty, pretty boys are nice, but I’m really here for the story. It’s a lot harder with anime, because while you’re listening to the words, your main focus is the art. And if the art is clunky or backgrounds treated as an afterthought, it becomes harder and harder not to turn into that nitpicky chick in the back that everyone throws their Calpis bottles at during DVD number 195 of Ranma 1/2.

The Tabernacle is a picture of Christ’s first ministry on the Earth. There was nothing in His appearance that we should desire Him, as the Scripture says in Isaiah, but internally, he was beautiful. The tabernacle would cost millions to make by today’s standards, since the interior shone due to all the gold. Yet, on the outside, the Tabernacle was not an extremely attractive tent. It was sort of bland. This shows Christ’s nature during His first ministry: not as impressive on the outside, but inwardly beautiful.
I am currently eating fresh strawberries and vanilla yogurt as I write this—Liberté’s Mediterrainée is the most wonderful vanilla yogurt you will ever eat…it’s like eating whipped cream on your berries…yum!

This year I decided to teach letters a bit differently. We went at it letter of the day style and finished pretty quick. This was all in effort create or own alphabetic code that I posted about a while back. My plan was to present all of the letters, one per day, then to go back and review. The thing is, they didn't need to go back. They learned the letters just as well as they did back when I took two or three days per letter. We still used McCraken's Spelling Through Phonics which works awesome!
After a nice day in the yard I headed out to a FunRaiser for a breast cancer organization called Team Towanda.

I was blessed to have both my sister Kelly and a friend Grace attend the party as my dates.
It will be quite a while before we visit with our psychotic backwoods friends again, for now we get to meet the Rat Pack of Wolfbreath College: three women all around thirty, who were thick as thick can be back in the day, defending one another from terrible boyfriends, domineering parents, and general boredom: Trina (Tiana Pierce), who lives in Beverly Hills and is some undefined way one of the beautiful people always giving and attending parties and generally being seen with and by important cinema folks (she is introduced at a party scene full of vapid Hollywood "deep" types that recalls, though it obviously does not match, the L.A. sequence of Annie Hall); Abbey (Nancy Hendrickson), living in cramped Chicago apartment with her unspeakably cruel hypochondriac mother; and Jackie (Deborah Luce), a New Yorker who makes the most spectacularly bad choices about men you could imagine. Once a year, these three women get together to go on mystery trips, in which only one member of the trio knows where they're headed or what they're doing there until they've arrived. This year, it's Jackie's turn, and she wants go go on a camping trip in the New Jersey woods. First, of course, they have to pass by a creepy convenience store manager (Scott Lucas), who warns them to stay away from Barons Wilderness. Though after they manage to destroy his shop, he's a lot less concerned with sending them off to their demise.

“What are you doing Thursday evening”. I had a function to cater at the Club.
I'd had lunch at 11:30, and I knew I wouldn't be eating until about 7:30, so I was hoping to have a little something to eat. Hoping to have a little something vaguely healthy to eat. Without actually ordering something real (like pizza or pasta), I was left with only sweet things. I almost didn't give in, but I mentioned the presence of tiramisu... My brother was unable to resist, so I opted for a Creme di Fragola. It included strawberries - they're healthy, right?
So last week I told you how my husband had set a challenge for me to ‘drive like a granny’. Well. The results are in. My hubby said that I wouldn’t see that much of an improvement with my fuel consumption from the first try, however, I managed to get an additional 75km (46mi) out of my tank! I was absolutely gobsmacked! I generally get about 620km (385mi) out of a full tank of petrol, but the fact that when I had to put in more fuel, my odometer was sitting at 695kg (431mi) blew my mind away. Don’t get me wrong… I still ‘put foot’ as such, especially with all of my idiot truck drivers on our roads, but wow. I am genuinely impressed and cannot wait to continue saving money on petrol, ESPECIALLY the way the price keeps jumping up.

The warp drive won the race, and I hit the next gate and jumped through. It was, however, pretty clear where I was headed. I started the warp to the next jump gate as soon as I could. And, sure enough, the whole gang jumped through to me and broke cloak all around again. This time only one of their ships started targeting me before I was in warp.
The man, of course, was Panaït Istrati, a young Romanian of Slavic and Greek descent who had led a most extraordinary life, one that had taken him around the Mediterranean, across eastern Europe and the Levant, and into and out of all kinds of jobs: “cabaret house boy, sandwich man, sign painter, house painter, journalist and photographer.” Along the way, Istrati had picked up stories as varied and entrancing as those of The Arabian Nights. Rolland took Istrati under his wing, recognizing in him a born storyteller (in his preface Rolland notes that Istrati’s storytelling prowess proved so irrepressible he’d interrupted the narrative of his own suicide note to weave in a few choice tales).

Statistically, over 400 billion cups of coffee are consumed every year, which is why coffee also happens to be the second most traded product in the world. In America alone, over 450 millions cups of Java are consumed on a daily basis, where the typical coffee drinker imbibes an average of three and a half cups a day. While it is already evident that the production and sales of coffee is healthy to any economy (especially in Brazil), what most health experts now are questioning is whether coffee is beneficial to one’s body in the long run.
But...eh, the princess, while nice enough, was mostly "stock cute orphan" mixed with "stock precocious girl" and I was never able to connect with her or even care about her.

Yes, America started it. While the Bush gang decries "blaming America for everything," it doesn't change the fact that many terrible events are the fault of American policies. It shouldn't boggle the mind too much. We have a worldwide Empire, and imperial actions will have consequences.

It was all set to the primal rhythm of a steady thumping backbeat complemented by a bass line hitting you everywhere. It caused dancing of the simplest pattern; hop hop, switch foot, hop hop, switch foot, hop hop; arms swinging back and forth in time to the movement of the always bouncing feet. The grass was bright and green and standing when the man next to me started dancing this basic jungle influenced sway. By mid concert he had danced the grass flat, by nights end, to mud.

John F. Watt has been a mystery that has me mystified since the 1980s. He was a prolific writer, but almost nothing appeared under his own name and trying to trace the network of pen-names he used is proving to be a nightmare. I've traced 46 pen-names so far and it seems very likely that he used double that number.
So a whistlestop journey through the amazing lovelies!

Little porky Anny opted not to chill out as a human being and stop taking things so seriously, going down the road of getting his pound of flesh while in the process convincing himself that his cause is just. You see my fellow pursuers of a harmonious zen state, there is knowledge and there is passion. Both equally dualistic. You can know everything in the world but without passion you will never be able to understand what you know. On the other side you can be passionate with ignorance at which point passion becomes what I phrase anti-passion. Anti-passion and passion are easy to discern from one another. Passion, which is infused with properly perceived knowledge always moves in the direction of freedom, peace and allowance of other human beings. Anti-passion however, always moves in the direction of bringing about peace through intolerant force. That’s the current leadership of the party, and that’s this guy. No doubt he dabbled in a few debate classes and all his friends are careful to avoid topics he might could turn into an argument because they’re sick of hearing him try to impress them with his anti-passionate rhetoric. Never works though because when he’s sitting at the huddle house sipping on a lemon water and he sees his friend pour ketchup on his scrambled eggs he just has to jump in his lap about it by bloviating on why its socially, economically, philosophically and theologically unacceptable to do so in public. Sheesh.

Some, for the sake of their political cause, have sought to downplay the magnitude of what occurred on that September day nine years ago today. “More have died elsewhere” they say, and it is true that there was greater loss of life in Nagasaki, Hiroshima and in Dresden, there were single days in Rwanda which saw greater carnage and it is also true that many more die in earthquakes and other natural disasters. However, there is a context to these things, and it was the context of 09/11 which sets it apart from acts of God and from the crimes of other men.

These are the kind of days that make kids skip one day to take a breather, and return the next striving for life-goals year after year. These are the kind of days that flood my text inbox with “Today was a good day.” They are the kind of days that bind. They make us more than family. They allow us to know each other. They are the kind of days that offer us moments of love, the kind of days that allow us time to understand.

There isn't much going on in terms of conventional storytelling in Street Trash: A bearded liquor store merchant finds a case of bottles (containing a beverage called "Viper") hidden behind a wall in his basement, dusts them off, and starts selling them to his mainly homeless customers. One by one, the thirsty vagrants try the curious wish-wash, only to find themselves twitching violently and melting into a pool of muck after taking a single sip.

What’s needed at these times is to slow down. While I can’t stop my self from making my quick judgment of the situation, what I can do is to delay announcing it.

I could tell how the last 3-4 miles were going by what I wasn't thinking. Usually I'm thinking "Get this guy!" or "Keep your legs moving! Work your hands!" but instead, the last few miles were spent mainly in numb contemplation of what went wrong. Was it the perfect storm of several extended work, family and personal commitments over the previous week? Or maybe that crash and burn 12-mile run nine days ago, even though I seemed to fully recover from it two days later. Did I blitz last Tuesday's tempo run too fast, and leave some of my race on the track? Have I not recovered from that sore throat I had last week?

Thanks for the Great blog. Something about myself. I have recently immigrated to a country were I had no job lined up or were I could not even speak the Language. To say that my first year was the most difficult time of my life would be a major understatement. I have now seemed to have crossed the largest hurdle, found a job and settled in. This is the sacrifice I had to make for my families freedom and survival. It saddens me however to read and hear about my beloved countries further decline into anarchy. I am therefore at a complete loss of words when the loved ones that remained behind have optimism for the future. What is this based on? Surely they are privy to the same information and news that I see and hear.

Okay. Here’s a big problem I have with that whole “pitchers and catchers” thing. It’s changed quite a bit from when I was a kid. Though it’s always been optional for anyone other than pitchers and catchers, it’s almost required now. But it’s not. Sort of. But it’s expected too. Sort of.

Answer: first check out www.thehuntingchannelonline.com resource center and use the mapping tools or google earth if you have it. Look at 3d and arial photos of the areas try to distinguish lanscape features that typically hold deer like, benches, water sheds, saddles and edges within these areas look for funnels, inside corners fence lines and anything you think will alter deer movement. mark those areas then locate thme in the filed and inspect for deer sign like: dropping signs of feeding, rubs and scrapes and deer beds. i areas of high potential useage place trail cameras up if you have them if not set up a stand in th eoff season far off the the areas an observe from a distance with binos. try to pattern what th edeer are doing, what type of deer you are getting etc. then pick a stand site accordingly. good luck

I’ve wanted to leave since the meeting was fifteen minutes old, but it’s impossible to exit gracefully that early. I decide to stay for 90 minutes, but I stick it out for 112 so I won’t scream "NO!" if someone asks, “Do you really have to leave so early?” There’s a fair chance that no one would, but there are people who delight in directing everyone’s rapt attention at some poor schmuck whose only crime was trying to sneak out the door. I remind myself to walk slowly when my mind finally rebels and orders my body to get it out of there. The cold air and silence are welcoming, but I’m too drained to enjoy them. I’m also sleepy, and my head hurts. I ask myself what good I got from going, and I can’t think of anything.

I've read a little about power travelling along cables (whether it's generated from solar or fossil fuels) losing a certain percentage to entropy. So more power has to be generated to replace the loss. It's not a huge amount compared to what power makes it through, but entropy does add up. I would think, efficient use of resources would encourage maximum electricity being used, closest to the source generating them. It's not like grid connected solar is the same as stand alone solar - where you may need to charge your batteries during the day so you have electricity at night. We have an electricity grid to plug into any time.

Millions of us will gather and visualize the liberation of our planet from the tyranny of the central bankers so that for the first time in our history we will have the chance to create our own destiny as free citizens of the Earth…LINK

When I got ready to paint, I stood on a chair so I could reach up near the ceiling. Imagine my surprise when I looked down and saw a hidden spot of dirt and grime, the top of my medicine cabinet! For all the times I had cleaned that bathroom, I had forgotten about this hidden area and boy, did it show!
Totally surprised at the turn of events, I pressed my husband for details. ”She started walking around and seemed fine,” he said. In fact, she walked all the way from the shrubbery to the coop, a good 30 feet and then up the ramp. Amazing!
You worry about him when she's gone, not sure if he's eating or sleeping properly, you're concerned he'll descend into a cycle of drink and despondency. You know they've planned to meet up in Canada in a month or two and you hope he'll stick to the plan, that they'll be back together soon. But you also know there's a downside to that.

Georgiy Bovt, writing in Izvestia, the Russian newspaper, also took a look at Obama’s first year. Suffice it to say he tore into the young President, along with the “reset” message he tried to send Russia and the rest of the world. Bovt said, “While Obama practiced conciliatory gestures, the camps of al Qaeda prepared and continues to prepare for future attacks.” He ripped the political correctness that leaves America vulnerable.

The changes proposed by the FBI to the training modules are a welcomed first step in ensuring that such a mistake does not occur again in the future. The group asked the FBI Director to issue a formal statement on this matter acknowledging the negative impact of these training materials on the Muslim community. Representatives from the community and interfaith organizations also stressed the importance of transparency by the Bureau in dealing with these matters, and suggested that a committee of community leaders and experts be assembled to review training material issued by the FBI. Meeting participants requested that the training process be open and transparent moving forward, and requested future meetings with Director Mueller to continue the conversation.

I got this gorgeous stamp set called Victorian Lady by Woodware a couple of weeks ago from The Craft Outlet near where I live. Have been itching to use it. I simply stamped and embossed it with clear embossing powder. Kept it quite simple by just adding a touch of colour to the hat brim and the bow. The patterned paper is a new one I got from Papermania. I used my trusty Big Shot to emboss the red panels. Just love my Big Shot machine. Added some ribbon across the centre, some pearls, feathers and flowers to finish.

Other stories have placed identity loss in the foreground. How often we talk about the loss of identity as being an effect of disability! Yet, the absence of crucial information about identity may itself be a Disability. Take, for instance, persons who are of First Nations (Native American) descent, but are cut off from their ancestral roots. This is a surprisingly common experience created by some of the same forces that marginalize persons who are traditionally disabled, including marginalization, colonialism, and enclosure. The overall effect of separation from one’s tribal roots is frequently to instill a sense of lost identity, and a haunting sense of one’s Self as incomplete. Efforts to regain tribal identity may be rebuffed by the tribe of origin for any number of reasons, although most of those relate to the protection of limited resources, and, oddly enough, tribal identity. The effect, however, is to reinforce the seeker’s sense of loss and alienation.

I have three cards for my Guest Design spot at Bah!Humbug! Challenge Blog. This is my third week with the lovely ladies of the manor so it seems only fitting to have three cards. The challenge was to make cards for "the boys". I decided to do one for three different age groups.

As the members of the Medical Brigade were given the tour, a young woman worked in the minimalist kitchen, preparing the family’s food. Under a tarp to shield from the bright sun and over a narrow workbench she kneaded corn flour, turning the dough into hand-pressed tortillas which then went onto a wood-fire stove. The stove was adobe brick itself and attached to the outside of the home. A pot of beans bubbled next to the two ‘burners’ occupied by the tortillas.

The width of this blog is 470 pixels. The width of images in my Etsy shop are 570 pixels. That means, I have to adjust them so they are 100 or more pixels smaller when I place them in the context of one of my posts. I do this by adding width=”470″ after the image location URL, as shown in the example below. The picture will stay proportional in size when only given a specified width or height measurement, so there is no need for me to figure out what the other measurement would need to be. This comes in handy when I am working with images of different widths, but want them all to be the same height, or vice-versa.
Before we get to the root causes, I feel it is necessary (for the sake of those who are not entirely familiar with this issue) to first discuss a few basic facts and features:

“Transmission is a big theme of this conference, and it’s a huge issue as we try to expand, so having these commissioners coming to Arizona to talk about these issues is a very big deal,” Mayes said. “By the same token, it’s critical to have these CEOs here to discuss where they see their industry going and also to delve into what they believe are the regulatory needs. This is an industry at a pivotal point and where we go from the legal and policy standpoints is going to be critical for them.”

4. ‘The Producers’ – in Manhattan with Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane in a 6 week revival of their roles – I can quite safely say I have never laughed so much. Even though it was a Sunday matinee, a performance time that I’ve always viewed as the graveyard shift, the level of hilarity was such that the Broderick and Lane succumbed to hysteria as well and had to leave the stage to compose themselves
Fishing for Numbers is a simple, quick game where students practice basic facts in addition and subtraction while using problem solving strategies. The first player rolls two dice and says the numbers. Then he/she looks at the empty spaces on the board and decides whether to ADD the numbers or SUBTRACT the numbers. Once a choice is made, the player says the number sentence aloud and places his/her marker over the answer. Play alternates in this fashion until one player covers all the spaces on his/her board.

“Encroachment must be eradicated and approval shouldn’t be given for development projects in these areas,” he said in his address.
Let’s be clear on one thing- there really isn’t a ‘Womack Militia.’ This fictitious moniker derives from the LEED-IE PAC’s shameless political ads in the local daily, seeking to demonize one of the county’s hardest working and most fiscally conservative public servants while mobilizing anti-conservative feelings to defeat GOP candidates that Commissioner Womack (and the Republican Party) support. Ironically, there is a groundswell of anti-liberal sentiment in Lee County. Citizens here are fed up with the boorish behavior of those who seek to perpetuate higher taxes and elevated spending levels without accountability in our county. Rather than a ‘militia,’ the voters of Lee County are coming after those who pretend to serve the interests of our citizens (but who really are just taking care of their buddies, the good old boys of Lee County).

The British government is the bond slave of the “invisible and inaudible” force centred in the City. The City calls the tune. The “visible and audible leaders” are mere puppets who dance to that tune on command. They have no power. They have no authority. In spite of the outward show they are mere pawns in the game being played by the financial elite.
The information in this field is organized mostly in books, which is amazing taking into consideration the fact that it’s a visual mode of communication, and the crucial thing is to have the visual memory of the movement in mind when one encounters the relevant gesture.

When I was about 13 years old, I used to go up to Chabot Observatory to the public show. They usually did some show & tell exhibits indoors and then if the night was clear, went and used their two telescopes. After awhile, they would let me lead parts of the program and it was great fun and education too. Due to that, I ended up taking 4 semesters of astronomy in college.

Archibald’s dream meant a great deal of travel, in exploration and surveying, and a great deal of frustration at the slow pace of Chinese life. But alongside the Littles’ interest in and huge sympathy for the Chinese people – whom they saw as being the victims of an inert and corrupt government in which all decisions were taken on the basis of a thousand-year-old ‘tradition’ irrelevant to the nineteenth century – was horror at the effects of the customary foot-binding which crippled women in pursuit of the ideal of tiny feet. Archibald had already noted that its effect was to force women to kneel to carry out agricultural labour, because they could not stand; and women who could barely walk were often forced to haul junks and barges.

If you are to truly ‘fit in’ to your community, just drinking Rakia is not enough, you’ll need to actually make it. It’s best to get your local ‘Mistor’ to help the first year, as there is a little more to making it than simply filling barrels full of rotting fruit, (unless you actually intend on blinding friends and neighbours.) Once made though, you will have enormous pride in your creation, foisting it on anyone who approaches your door. However be warned, it can be a little dangerous to spend a long dark winter knowing you have 50 litres of 60+ proof alcohol in your shed. If you can, allow it to age, then you can take it with pride to Bulgarian parties where it will be scrutinized, ‘that’s peach, from hummmm……. (swish round mouth and concentrated look)… 2010?’

I am still trying to recover from the chills I had all over on Saturday night when I saw Les Miserables at the Fabulous Fox Theater. It was, in a word, INCREDIBLE! My parents gave me 2 tickets for Christmas and it was one of the best gifts I’ve ever received. I love musical theater, and Les Miserables is one of the most beautiful compilations of song in the world. In fact, I not only was covered in chills, but my heart was racing, it took my breath away, and tears filled my eyes several times. It is that good!
This assessment by the Trial Chamber is more consistent with the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. One of the intriguing features of the transitional justice mechanisms in Sierra Leone is that the two main bodies, the Special Court and the Truth Commission, have not necessarily shared the same vision of the conflict. The Court has focused on external factors, blaming Taylor, Ghaddafy and others for the civil war. The Truth Commission, on the other hand, tended to downplay the role of external actors like Taylor and proposed an analysis that found the main cause of the conflict to be the decades of tyranny and corruption within Sierra Leone. With its more modest perspective on the involvement of Taylor, the 26 April 2012 judgment

The weekend was spent overseas; we had been invited to three days of celebrations for a good friend’s birthday. The events were to take place on the neighbouring Isle, and as usual it was no mean feat getting ourselves organised and onto that ferry boat, although we did have to succumb to a slightly reduced ‘party time table’, missing out on a clay pigeon shoot and cask visit.

Deep down we all want to laugh. But for many, they are afraid to laugh. If they laugh, they have to let go of their pain for just a moment. And if their pain is their security blanket, it makes them vulnerable if even for a split second.

It’s customary for the bride’s sister to be maid or matron of honor, and if she has more than one sister, for the role to be shared between them. Regardless of how close you are, it’s probably best to ask your sister to stand with you at the altar, especially if it will cause a family rift if you don’t.
So, this is a controlled rant. Why? Over the years I have found it is much easier to find the root of the problem and concentrate on ranting on that root rather than the whole tree. The associate that helped us originally, was very good at her job and did everything right. It was the delivery company that caused the problem and then because they don't have to deal with me directly, can sit on their lazy butt and just say 'no' for no reason. The store is at their mercy as well seeing as how they only have one delivery company.

In 2008 millions of Christians from 214 nations united in prayer and on 31 May 2009 a miracle happened when this initiative miraculously expanded to 220 countries in the world. Together with the 10 Days leading up to and the 90 Days of Blessing following the Global Day of Prayer, there was a sense that the call to unity and repentance is deepening. This lay the foundation for God to fill the nations with His glory as His children from around the world cried out to him in unity.

Anecdote time: Shortly after I moved to New York, I was riding the subway in the Bronx, on my way to work. While sitting on the train, a woman—who was black—sat down next to me in a seat that didn’t exist. Which is to say that three people were already on the subway bench and she decided to sit down anyway, effectively squishing everyone else. Not thrilled with the idea of spending my remaining train ride getting to accidental first base with a fellow passenger, I simply got up and went to stand by the door. This woman—and I remember this vividly—then turned to me and said loudly enough for most of the surrounding car to hear: “Racist.”

Her saintly calling is opposed by Satan. He would shatter the family unit and demean the worth of woman. He would triumph if one man would offend or fail to honor her, or if one woman would deny her infinite worth and behave beneath her dignity.

Furthermore, as more reporting is transmitted online, more and more online journalists including bloggers are being attacked and even killed for their work,” Mr. Alam and Mr. Ketkar said.

I also hear this woman say, “I miss you like you can’t imagine,” to the man on the other end of the line. I can even see her smile as she whispers words of comfort and security. I smile when I hear her laughter, the soft laughter which I am sure makes that person far away smile dreamily as well. That person far away whom I cannot hear no matter how much of myself I immerse in this little corner in my head. I cannot hear what he says to make her eyes light up like they do at such moments, but I know it must be much more than I can imagine when she tells him, “I don’t have to dream of you; you are my dream.” I wish I can hear those words when I am outside of my head.
A couple of weeks before we got married, Hubby was on a pre-planned mission trip in the Darien Jungle in Panama. When he got back to the States, he didn't feel so great. Three days before our wedding, he was slammed with a headache and a fever of 104 and I think some other things. My mom told me to take him to the ER. I did. And the ER was apparently busy or something (even though they didn't look it), and they left Hubby lying on the floor (because he hurt too much to stand up) for about three hours until they got him back into a room.

Well, your time has arrived, dear Gemini. This week, the Sun enters your sign boosting your energy, giving you an opportunity to recharge your batteries for the rest of the year. Yay! In particular, it will inexplicably attract people and opportunities to you. (Milk this for all its worth because this doesn't happen all the time.) For example, the next month is the only time all year when the Sun will be in Gemini. This also marks the beginning of your personal year (birthday to birthday), so it certainly behooves you to develop a rough expectation of what you want this year to be all about. (It never hurts to have a plan, Stan.) What's it going to be?

Onto business: today is Valentine's Day. I like Valentine's Day. I do not have a valentine, nor do I have the opportunity to get one before the day is out--regardless, I like Valentine's Day. It provides us with a day focused completely on telling people you love that you love them. While if you need a day to remind you that you love the ones you love, you might need to refocus your priorities, I appreciate the fact that Valentine's Day gives me an excuse to tell people I love them, to reconnect with old friends, and to spend a day surrounded by love.

Phew! Are you still here? If so, to sum up, I think everyone needs a first novel. Whether it's successful or not. Because regardless of what stage you are in with the writing game, you're going to have to face all of the emotional ups and downs that come with being brave enough to call yourself a writer.
In March 1911, an Italian film entitled L'inferno was released. Deemed the first full-length Italian motion picture, it is also noteworthy for being loosely based on Dante Alighieri epic poem "The Divine Comedy". In the poem, Dante travels through the three aspects of the Christian afterlife: Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise, or Heaven). Many artists have used this poem as inspiration for their illustrations, perhaps most notable among them Gustave Doré, whose etchings graced the 1857 edition of the poem. It was this edition which inspired the film. (view the etchings here)

It is of particular attention that faced with an unending resistance in Iraq, the US had planned to spark a civil war between the Sunnis and Shias. In this context, a study of the Rand Corporation, titled ‘US Strategy in the Muslim World After 9/11′ was conducted on behalf of the then US Deputy Chief of Staff for Air Force.
Re-reading this post, it sounds like my day was pretty boring, but I did enjoy it a great deal; maybe that’s the mark of comfort. I know Delhi is busy, and I can see the millions of people swarming from place to place, but it just doesn’t feel that way. This might be a function of me being more comfortable with India or Delhi just being a wonderful place to live, but either way I am glad I get another day here to experience it some more.

The report -- put together after a November 2010 session, months before protesters challenged Qaddafi's legitimacy and prompted an historic confrontation with his regime -- includes dozens of recommendations for how Libya can improve human rights. But it also includes pages of commentary, mostly positive, from the other 46 delegations to the controversial Human Rights Council.
months later i get an email from one of the organizers inviting me to see some photos that i thought were from the reunion. (you do see where this is going, right?) ok, so, yeah, i do it, after a couple of clicks declining to send a note to everyone i ever knew, i hit cancel and thought no more about it. then i get an email from my high school pal apologizing for the "tagged" requests i'd (along with a gazillion other people in her adressbook) been getting. so after that, every time i saw a tagged email, i deleted it without opening. yesterday, guess what pops up in the mail? subject line: ***** (they used my my real name), is this your photo? whatever, i hit delete and thought no more about it. well, guess what? it was a photo from OUR iphotos library! yep, the MITM opened it and saw one of our trip photos! holy moley, right? how did that happen? i googled "tagged" to see wtf was going on and how it could have happened. the following is just ONE of the answers i found:

I'll get some pictures up as soon as I get them loaded onto my computer. The other day was the first time I had picked my camera up in weeks! I just needed a break! Things were going way too fast for me, and I didn't feel I was ready for where it was taking me. People were asking me left and right to do family pictures, baby pictures, birthday pictures - and while I love that they love my photos, *I'M* not where I want to be yet, and I don't want to give anything to anyone that I'm not happy with myself.

Brands seem to be adhering to the "next big thing” concept with their ads; so much so as I want to label these kind of spots as “pop commercials.” These are the commercials that have been pumped out with the main purpose being to generate a shock value or to be the Diddy of advertising. Companies want their spots to be the talk of the town for a day, a week, or a month…Cough Rebecca Black Cough. But sometimes that doesn’t happen because they lack depth. Commercials that have some depth to them will be the ones you will always remember, the ones you save on your YouTube account or the ones you and all your friends talk about.

Birth Matters is a profoundly encouraging book arguing a way forward for reconciling our modern lives with the act of birth. At its core, Birth Matters recognises that birthing is a feminist issue. In interviewing Ina May Gaskin I asked her all the difficult questions that had been bubbling around in my head since my own birth experiences and I am delighted to say that she was very generous, and not unexpectedly, quite fearless in taking my questions on…

This past weekend was amazing. I knew as soon as my dad told me that him and Mom were going to a classic car show in Myrtle Beach that I wanted to go. The only problem was Alex had to work that weekend and I didn't want to go by myself. Insert Jill. I knew she would go with me and went she did. We left right after school Friday afternoon and we were on our way by 3:30. We arrived in MB at the hotel where my parents were staying (we didn't stay on the beach) around 7:45. We unloaded the cars and met with my parents in their room. My parents had already eaten but they decided to ride along with Jill and me to grab a bite. After dinner it was an early bedtime since morning would come too soon.

Even Daniel realizes what a catch she would make for his father, and after a really, really amazing carriage ride back from a party (I’m surprised the cushions didn’t burst into flame), Ainsley agrees to think about going away to Paris with Cam to have an affair. When she shows up, almost missing the train, Cam realizes that he can’t ruin the woman with whom he is half in love already, so he bullies her into marrying him in London before they head off to the continent, Daniel in tow.

The man who has lived in this house for several years is the grandson of the farmer who built it, and it was passed down three generations to the degenerate who has let the thing go to hell. OK, to be fair, his mother wasn’t much better. When she owned the house, she would decorate the lawn for the seasons and then leave everything up all year—Christmas lights, a plywood cutout of Santa riding a rocket, a hay bale with pumpkins in various stages of decay, plastic Easter eggs hanging from the lower branches of the scraggly trees. Trick-or-treating kids would walk an arc around the place to avoid it on Halloween.

I Thessalonians 5:16-18 (NLT)
Shortly after I completed my drawing of the newborn fawn entitled “A Peaceful Spot,” Mindy let me know that she wanted another baby animal picture to hang on our wall. You see, our little fawn was looking kind of lonely hanging on our living room wall all by herself, and we thought she could use a friend. Also, Mindy revealed that she had envisioned decorating our baby’s room with baby animal pictures one day when we decide to start a family. For any of our family members or friends reading this, no, Mindy is not pregnant, so don’t read into this discussion about baby room decorations as anything more than thoughts for the future. Anyway, we started talking about what little forest friend I would venture to draw next, and after a little conversation, we settled on a baby raccoon. I agree with Mindy that baby raccoons look all cute and cuddly even if the adults are none too cute and can cause all kinds of havoc, especially around unsecured, full garbage cans.

I know people who always feel terrible after they give a talk, even if the talk was great (in my opinion). For some, the experience is such an anxious one, that is is difficult to enjoy the experience of giving a talk, even if the talk is interesting and presented well. I hope that for most people, this anxiety fades with time and experience giving talks.

Today, we’re having one of those days where we don’t venture too far from home – tidying up (why does our house always look so messy after the weekend?), doing washing and just taking each hour as it comes.

Mattias and the crew had congregated on the quarter deck to devise a plan. In all honesty the situation looked bleak, much worse than Stacey could have guessed. They were out manned, and had been caught by surprise. Mattias had been in tight spots before, but even he couldn't see a way out of this one, and the crew could see it on his face. The other ship's men were already boarding, which meant that he couldn't place his men in any strategic way, they were on the quarter deck, and that's where they would make their stand. He also couldn't have them try to run, because there weren't enough men to fight who had boarded AND get the ship going.

These are the questions I ask myself as I sit in the dark, or as I walk city streets at night. I long for the comfort of their over-stimulation on a more constant basis. Their cocoon is a more constant and whole Venus von Villendorf for my ceaselessly moving mind-state. The shine of her signage breasts. The curve of her Earthly hips made of concrete and curbs–a land of thresholds–doors awaiting my hand to turn them, or simply a thought. The walkers and their shadows–her dreadlocks and simultaneously–her children. Hers but not owned.

I’ve never been an enormous Streep fan, but the more of her recent work I see, the more I respect her, and I’m hard-pressed to think of another American film actress who could bring the ambiguities of Sister Aloysius to life. I’m a shameless Hoffman fan, and both he and Adams deserve their Globe nominations (nothing against Viola Davis at all– her one scene is quite devastating, but it is just one scene, and I’m tired of award-granters handing out nominations for such minimal parts). I’m fairly certain that at least two of the three will show up in the Oscar nomination roll call as well. Unfortunately, the film itself is too stilted to really bring anything truly cinematic to the fore – it remains essentially a filmed play, lacking that extra spark to make it a great movie.

This kind of racist/chattel slavery has been explicitly condemned by the Church since it was first practiced in the middle of the 15th century. A series of Papal bulls forbade the expropriation and enslavement of indigenous peoples, and threatened with excommunication those who participated in them. Everyone from individuals to entire nations felt at liberty to defy these Papal pronouncements, but they were made. Had such things been clearly and universally sanctioned by Scripture, the Church would likely not have excommunicated those who innocently partook in them. But there was clearly something about chattel slavery that was in clear opposition not only with Scripture but with Tradition, with the natural law, and with common decency, hence the Church’s firm and repeated condemnation of it.

1 and 1/2 months ago I had an experience in Eucharistic Adoration which enlightened me that my discernment is no longer discerning God’s will, but discerning what tools He has equipped me with. I have one of two tools. I either have a very broad love that is able to encompass the community and the Church, or a love that is very narrow in scope and directed to one other person. This has been the theme of my discernment over the past month. I really thought though that I was called to seminary either way. However the issue now is that I seem to be finding more and more that as I embrace a more narrow idea of love that is rooted in a holy relationship, my past sores and scars begin to feel as if they are being healed over. I find myself more capable of complete forgiveness of self and others.

Artifacts from saloons included bottles, bungs, white and red clay pipes, dice, animal bones, oyster shells, buttons, bullets, coins and even a tooth powder box. A water filter made in London and a glazed earthenware spittoon were represented by photos. There was also a case devoted to the Chinese population of Virginia City, (Sarah Heffner's special subject), including Chinese coins, pottery, tiny medicine bottles, a bone toothbrush and an opium pipe. It was a delightful half hour travelling back in the past. If you have any interest in the archaeology of the Wild West – or Virginia City – and find yourself on the Reno campus, I urge you to go along to the University of Nevada, Reno Anthropology Research Museum.

(I do this with movies sometimes, going in with absolutely no information except for the title. One of the first times was with the Irish movie "The Snapper," an adaptation of Roddy Doyle's novel about an unexpected baby. The title was obscure but vaguely misleading; the movie was delightful. Thereafter I attempted to repeat it as often as possible. Not so easy with beer, but still I try.)
The West Bank has been reduced to a series of discontinuous Bantustans separated by Israeli settlements, as I forecast would happen, and the new “Security Fence” breaks up these communities even more. In Gaza, the Palestinians have shown themselves incapable of undertaking even the most basic functions of a state in maintaining order, even allowing for the actions of the Israeli state in creating conditions which made that more difficult. But, the Israeli state has been able to justify those incursions, because of continued terrorist attacks, on Israel, by those elements, within Palestine, that would never accept the existence of Israel, whatever arrangements were made for Palestinians, again as I said was obvious would happen 20 years ago.

Carlos offered to accompany me in a cab back to my place. I had had a few and was becoming blinded by the items on the Dollar Menu, so I said yes.

I attended another recital at 4:30, this one for a fellow horn player, and I even stuck around afterwards and practiced on my horn for about an hour! I was proud of myself. From the music building, I contacted my friend Lexi. Recall that I first met Lexi on Twitter back in May or so of last year and officially met her last fall when I visited her church, which I now attend. Through me, Aaron started following Lexi on Twitter, and they got to the point where they tweeted each other quite a bit. So I arranged for the two of them to officially meet. Lexi and I went and ate at Chipotle while Aaron ate dinner with his family, and then Lexi and I picked Aaron up. The three of us went to Bahama Buck’s and talked for a while before driving back to the Tech campus and watching a movie in the room (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which neither of them had seen before). It was a nice little get-together, and Andrew even got to meet Lexi for the first time; he had been working at Relay for Life with his fraternity, but he made a quick visit to the room when he learned that Aaron was here. Such a good evening!

Many others have commented more fully on the show, on what happened, and what impact it is likely to have on the future on the BritNat party. An impact which I personally believe will be positive. Polls are already showing that a growing number of people, more than one in five, would now consider voting BNP. We can only speculate as to what the number would be had Griffin been given the fair hearing which he was democratically entitled to, and which the BBC's charter required them to give him.

So, what does one do to celebrate a Star Wars holiday? First of all, wear your favorite Star Wars t-shirt. If you've ever considered wearing a Jedi robe to work, this is the day to do it. Then send one of these very cool May the 4th e-cards to friends. After you do that, the most obvious answer is to have a marathon. Make Star Wars cookies, have friends over, have some toy lightsaber duels - you know, just another Friday night. Don't forget to make this Severed Wampa Arm cake!
Despite being 600 pages long, it is not bloated and there always seems to be something happening. The characters are richly illustrated and you can really get an insight into the harsh world that the Clan lives in. Auel takes pride in explain the surroudings and the Ice Age world that Ayla inhabits. There is so much to absorb here that you forgive the times when very little happens. The conflict itself drives the plot effortlessly and for this Auel should be commended.
What is the basis of our hope and confidence in God? John the Evangelist tells us that “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16). Jesus’ death on the cross won for us our salvation and adoption as the children of God. The love and mercy of Jesus Christ, the forgiveness of sins, and the gift of the Holy Spirit are freely given to those who acknowledge Jesus as their Lord and Savior. Is your hope securely placed in Christ and his victory on the cross?

Trinidad is one of those God forsaken small towns that seem to revolve around gossip, alcohol and high school athletics. I began my life in town as a 7th grader, still seething with disparity and hatred. As the new kid, I had no choice but to be bullied and sought refuge with my kindred, primarily Jimmy, another 7th grader who would become a lifelong friend. By the time we had made it to high school and I had made friends out of my tormentors, I had entered into a phase of delinquency and drug use in which I would swallow any pill on the table and turn coat on practically anyone if there was anything in it for me, especially a female.

From December 2011 to January 2012, we added 284,000 non-farm payroll employees, had 1.177 million drop out of the labor force and the unemployment rate dropped from 8.5% to 8.3%. From January 2012 to February 2012, we added 227,000 non-farm payroll employees, had 310,000 fewer people drop out of the labor force and the unemployment rate stayed the same. Hmmm. We created 57,000 less new non-farm payroll employees than the month before. We had a swing in the “not in labor force” category of 1.487 million people. Yet the rate was unchanged. Confusing?

The city issued no complaint, rather adjusting, shrugging somehow without movement. It seemed to almost enjoy the more demure gray suit slowly turning to charcoal, confident in not losing to black. Its own glow now brought intrigue, contrast and highlights hitherto unseen in the lights of day. It was just more comfortable with it. This city radiated pride and excitement at night; indeed finding its clarity and resonance as the sun slipped round the world.

And boy, am I glad I did. Shingeki no Kyojin has now become the shounen manga I swear by, the shounen manga I console myself with when I’m annoyed with Bleach and when I’ve all but given up with Naruto. But more than that, it’s the manga I point to as the epitome of Japanese storytelling…apart from Kare Kano. Hehe.

Sometimes I show the children a picture of an unusual house and ask them who lives there, then we make up a story about that character. The children come up with lots of weird and wonderful answers but I’ve noticed that the favourites are aliens, zombies and princesses that have been kidnapped by a wicked witch. The scarier the story the more the children love it. They have a great sense of fair play though and the baddies are always killed in the end and the princess always either outwits the witch and escapes or occasionally a prince drops by and kills the witch for her.

It works the same way in our life. We end up paying too high a price because of lifestyle drainers that steal energy from our lives. Living well requires that a leader periodically evaluates his connections. I have identified at least nine lifestyle energy drainers in my own life.

Moreover, there are many reasons why spot gold rebounded back towards the $1650 level within hours of the otherwise disappointing Fed statements on April 25 and headed higher the next day.

Everyone knows the economy is lousy, and has been for the last several years. But our liberal friends ask us what, exactly, the Republicans will do to make it better. The answer is complex, of course, and includes several long-term issues. But I always say that there are two obvious areas of low-hanging fruit: energy policy and regulation. A new administration could give our economy a quick and substantial boost by encouraging, rather than blocking, the development of America’s vast energy resources, and by stopping the promulgation of endless regulations that burden business and, by imposing needless costs, make us all poorer. The Obama administration has been destroying wealth through irrational regulation at an unprecedented, and accelerating rate, as depicted in these charts from an earlier post:

Carrie Fundingsland – It’s funny that you ask. Just last night I was running through my head all the things that I miss doing - hobbies I did before running my own business and raising a family. I am really interested in fashion design, nothing to mass market, just unique pieces I can wear myself. I also miss painting. I’ve barely picked up a brush since I left art school. I’d love to find the time to take some fine arts classes, perhaps in oils or charcoal.

In the Philippines, we have this… idea of Associationism. We are a people who are so fond of grasping at similarities and connections between ourselves and those who possess greater stature in a last ditch attempt to give our lives that shine others seem to have. It makes me think that maybe, even as a society, we have come to doubt the greatness in ourselves. We look back at the history of our great nation, we consider that maybe, it’s a product of all those who sought to make our land their own, and in this way, we had developed what we all refer to as the “colonial mentality”. But it seems to go beyond just feeling inferior to the races of a “higher caliber” (so we come to believe); or maybe, in a way, it doesnt.
A quick glance at my inbox reveals what I had a hunch might be there, a short comment by Carl Johan Calleman on the Egyptian phenomenon, saying that while this was not part of the surge in spiritual consciousness the Mayans were predicting, it is the first seeding of this surge, and amazing in itself. The real stuff, he continues, is going to be felt beginning on March 8, 2011, as a wave that builds in steps until it flashes complete and lasts through the Mayan calendar’s best known end date of December 21, and beyond.

People need to stop forming angry mobs that go around assaulting people and trashing property. We are supposed to be a civilized nation. The actions of people congregating into vicious mobs and hurting people and destroying property does nothing to help anyone’s cause. We live in the best country on Earth. So, why are we acting like insanely violent, out of control, rampaging savages? Those seeking equality and justice are never going to get it acting like a bunch of uncivilized savages hell-bent on destruction. That is not how a civilized race should behave. Get a grip!

With polls showing a large majority of Americans weary with the war, the president’s aides have discussed whether to accelerate current plans, which call for withdrawing 23,000 troops by September.

Mr. Yarnworks returned to the war and I dutifully went to PT 3x a week for 6 weeks. While I enjoyed the massages, they really didn't help the headache. Exploring my options, I also visited an eye doctor for the first time in....well, in my adult life. I'd felt that my vision was getting worse, but had avoided the eye doctor, so with the headache, it was time to go. Verdict? 20/20 vision....but it COULD be corrected to 20/15 if I wanted. So I got glasses. They greatly help with road signs and such, but didn't help with the headaches. So at least I ruled that out. The eye doctor was also a bit concerned about my field-of-vision test, which showed a blip on each eye where I couldn't see. The same spot on each eye, just mirror image. To her, that screamed of a pituitary gland issue.

However, she does arrive at some of the same conclusions as other scholars. The virgin birth in Bethlehem and the crucifixion are more myth than fact. It is interesting that the Dead Sea Scrolls provide the same sort of evidence of the life of Jesus as do the Nag Hammadi Gospels. The Dead Sea Scrolls appear to be part one and the Gnostic Gospels of Nag Hammadi appear to be part two of the same story! Alone these non-canonical texts are puzzling, but as a part of a trinity with the canonical Bible they create a tapestry of truth.

It made me feel a little depressed the more I think about it. Why in the world is my FSH so abnormally high? My mother went through menopause in her late 40s early 50s! No answers really. I read somewhere that female carriers of the fragile X gene can have this issue. How could I carry fragile X when NO ONE in my family has ever had a child with this problem, and I don’t think this is typically an asymptomatic gene. I guess I just have to chalk up the FSH level to crappy luck.

Once they were on the outing, I couldn’t help but see Freda and Brenda as younger variations on the characters Beverly and Angela from Mike Leigh’s 1977 classic play Abigail’s Party, at which Beverly hosts a dinner party for her new neighbours and it goes deadly wrong. Leigh’s play, and the TV staging of it, of course came after this book was written, but I saw it back then when I was 17 and it has stayed with me ever since. It was a kitchen-sink drama relocated to the posher lounge; a comedy that you had to increasingly grit your teeth to get through, as the awfulness of what was happening revealed itself, but you couldn’t help laugh/grimace at. There is much of this grit your teeth comedy in later stages of The Bottle Factory Outing too, and Bainbridge’s true genius is in how she resolves everything and makes us, the reader, complicit in what happens.

When I was in seminary, one of my greatest concerns was that most of my fellow seminarians were so focused on Christ’s divinity that they forgot about Jesus’ humanity. While his being the son of God is important for the salvation story, so is his humanity. In order to bridge the schism, he had to be both. By showing us that he could live at the intersection of human and divine, he was able to point the way for us to find it as well.

Ironically the man that should be his chief rival, Dayron Robles, has somewhat mirrored his accomplishments of late. In '07 Robles broke through to the sub13 ranks with a sterling 12.92 - equaling Liu's '07 world leader. In the Olympic season with Liu on the shelf injured, Robles broke Liu's WR by .01 with his 12.87. He followed up by going to Beijing and won gold in 12.93 - Liu won his in 12.91! Finally, this year, while Liu was rehabbing, Robles suffered through injuries of his own - leading to a World Championships final without either athlete on the track.

One lovely soul took the bummer lamb I was raising. The bummer lamb who wasn't weaned. The bummer lamb who thought he was either a chicken or a person, and so would break out of the pasture to hang out with the chickens or on her front porch. I was so happy to not have to worry about Lambchop, and didn't want to have to prematurely "process" him. Lamb formula is expensive and we had already been through an entire bag. Thanks to her, our freezer is now full of the most amazing lamb you have ever experienced. This was all after mowing my lawn with a broken mower and bringing Jon dinner the night I was admitted to the hospital. She didn't ask what she could do...she just showed up. Thanks, Rickie.
T: I think there is so much possibility of perfecting each little detail in the studio, that the soul of the music can die if everything is over analyzed and microcosm’d. When music is recorded, live or in the studio, its kind of hard to explain but I feel that the soul of the music is being recorded and captured, and that hopefully it can be relayed to the listener. When people get goosebumps listening to music maybe that’s a small part of the soul of the recording speaking to them; when there is emotional attachment with the listener with a given recording. What is it about Joplin, or Hendrix, or Billie Holiday, or even further back Robert Johnson, that continues to move people? It is something that transcends time and space and just continues to hit home with the listener. Coming back to the perfection of the recording studio, many inexperienced producers and engineers don’t have the smarts to stop! They keep going for perfection, and there is no soul in perfection. What makes a good record is the ability to capture that elusive feeling that a band can make. The first take, the guide track vocal may not be perfect, but it could be more emotionally moving then the perfect final vocal. Always go back to where you started to make sure you’ve still got that thing that moved you when you first heard the song, the performance.
No doubt the gay community, like other minority communities, needs some amount of affirmation. But you have to wonder what affirmation must mean if it demands all of these bright smiles, winsome singing and inane lyrics. They're bad enough in straight musical comedy, where they can frequently be undermined as camp. But in a gay revue, what you get is a kind of cutesy, clean-cut camp - even in the S&M number.

Rory McIlroy shot 1 under 71 and Tiger Woods finished with a pair of bogeys to shoot even par-72. The bogey on 18 was actually a good save after his tee shot went into the trees and resulted in an unplayable lie.Woods opened its rattling around in his first tee shot from a tree and put the second in the creek well to the left of the second fairway. He recovered pars on both and felt pretty decent for the round, all things considered.

Despite this attention to detail, something of a dilemma can arise when you order a beer you are not familiar with. You go through the ritual of tapping and spliling the cask, you draw some off and are pleased it has cleared nicely and appears suitably lively in the glass. However, when you come to taste it, it's just not right. It's not off in so much that it's oxidised, sour or infected, it's just plain bad! The beer could be overtly bitter or cloyingly sweet. It could be too thin, unbalanced or just badly brewed. It might even be as the brewer intended and it's just down to personal preference that you don't like it. If you're a regular beer drinker though, with faith in your own judgement, you know deep down that for whatever reason something is not right with the beer and worryingly you could be left with 70 odd pints of beer that you will struggle to sell!

Update: The Sunday Times is a British newspaper. The item about Obama agitating for Israel’s return to the 1967 borders originated in the Times. Has this been reported in the US press? Recall, the first time we learned about George Hussein Onyango Obama, the president elect’s half-starving, half-brother, was from the British press. Is this the case with resepct to Obama’s direction with Israel? If the American press intends to abrogate its responsibility to report about this man, much as the same media neglected to report the truth about the invasion of Iraq—scouring the foreign news media will become a must.

But did he, really? As it the trend with celebrities, the public has this inate impression that because somebody is under the scrutiny of the public eye, they have to maintain saint-like goodness every waking moment of the day and that any stumbling bad boy act they carry out is multiplied in severity to the nth degree. That’s not possible. Granted, Lennon has had his fair share of temper-shredding moments on the pitch, but that’s not to say that Rangers’ mangerial staff have been angelic either. At the end of the day, Lennon is an ordinary man with a wife and children. He just happens to manage a football team that has long-since-faded Catholic roots at its core.

His goal is to make sense of that pile. Tibco’s mantra: the right information to the right people at the right time in the right context. “I have this idea that math now trumps science,” Ranadivé says. “The simplest example is the thermostat in your house. You don’t need to have a Ph.D. in weather. Your thermostat simply looks at the temperature, and if it gets cold, it turns the heater on. And then the minute the temperature gets too hot, it turns the heater off. You don’t need to be a weather scientist to do that, okay? Like what we did for Reliance Communications. It’s the same thing. You don’t really have to know the why of something. Or the how. You just know if a and b happen, then c will happen.”

It takes a lot of courage and energy to live in Haiti, most of us live on so much stress. Thieves are everywhere, people are being attacked on broadlight day. Thieves have broken into my house twice (second time we had the time to call the police - although the police did nothing at all) after that it took me quite a while to get back to normal. Always stressed and jumpy, could not sleep, could not eat could not function properly and everytime things seems to get (less worst - not much better, the news of someone you know that has been gunned down while leaving the bank, or getting home late or have been kidnapped would drag me right back to the starting point. Therefore between so many bad news, the politician and the new president of Haiti we can't ask for worst and life is far from being pink.

Born on Christmas eve: welcome to the world Jason Nicolas. It’s been a ride seeing you grow in your lively mother’s belly, and now you are here. It still baffles all of us.

Banner turns into the Hulk and destroys the lab, causing everything to get shut down by the government and Banner to be arrested the next morning. Betty’s father the military general (Sam Elliott) comes in and arrests Banner despite Betty’s pleas otherwise – he’s ONLY a danger to all mankind as long as he’s free, after all! Why do some parents have to be so inconsiderate?

I need curtains because those big blank white squares of mini blinds are killing me!!! But I just have not found any premade that I like and I don't sew....I know...I know...what kind of woman am I. I cook...really well in fact...but I don't sew and I no longer feel any shame in it...LOL
When you go to the White House, there is only one voice they give to the public. They prefer to work behind the scenes.
Day 2- a movie that helped you get through the hard times, or one that jumps out at you after your loss
I also have the concern of how would Maddux take this?
There is one question I want to ask you before we get to that, because that’s the conclusion of the discussion.
Now that Facebook is going public, it’s time for me to quit. Slavery is long over (in the U.S., at least), and I’m not ready to be sold for a mere one hundred and twenty-five dollars.

My kids do not have that need, they have never had teaching, lessons, curriculum and tests.They are incredibly knowledgeable about various things. I could not have begun to teach them what they know. They have truly learned so much in their own way and time. It's their life and mind and nobody should control that but them.

Night two was after his birthday party and he had no nap! So I rocked him to sleep in Callie's room in no time and laid him down. He again woke up around midnight but this time I worked to get him back down in the bunk beds - he didn't throw much of a fit and went back down for the night in his bunk bed.
I used a bat cookie cutter as a stencil to make my felt bat. Once you have your felt bat cut out, all you need to do is hot glue it to your wooden dowel or clip on earring blank, whichever you prefer. I used a little bit of felt to cover the hot glue on the back of the bat, and to make it even more durable.
Are you the kind of person that would carry a friend to Jesus? What if there are obstacles, do you give up? What if a third party needs help bringing his friend to Jesus, are you willing to help?
However, we can demonstrate that Daud has profited out of every stage of the process that he has been driving as a politician!

It was otherworldly and I chalk it up to one word: tiède. The pain au raisin that I received—and promptly demolished—was still a bit warm from the oven. This meant that the butter and pastry cream or whatever was baked into it made the dough soft and springy, sweet and savory, melty and just this side of rich. It put a spring in my step all day.
The plaintiffs are represented by South Brooklyn Legal Services and the Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady, the two law firms that represented individual plaintiffs in the Atlantic Yards eminent domain suit and thus had professional contacts with Council Member James, whom the workers apparently first sought out.
Congratulations again, Cathy-Lynn, and thanks to everyone who visited our blogs during the Heartfelt Creations Design Team Alumni Blog Hop!
This ties into the previous point of the characters as types. The details of the types are almost of no consequence – if Vincent had gone to another country for three years, with a different set of funny, interesting associated dialogue, it would have no consequence for the character. The details are of no consequence for motivation with one exception – the boxer’s need for the gold watch.
The Earth is shifting; in fact, it is getting an entire new grid system. The tectonic plates are wobbling magnetically as well. So finding and staying in our centers is becoming more difficult. Some symptoms that are popping up for people that are extra sensitive to the Earth’s energies might be mild nausea, like morning sickness, a slight dull headache that won’t go away, and a sore spot in the heart chakra area. These are temporary situations.

When designing our home, I dreamed of a little breakfast room with a window where we could enjoy our weekend mornings, lingering over the table with a cup of coffee and the paper or a magazine. The room would also double as a place for casual dinners and easy get-togethers with friends.
I'm still having way too much fun with Instagram, obviously.
One thing that I think is insane about this class is that in any given class, it is normal to do at least 800 repetitions within the hour. For me, that is mind-blowing!
Here is my card for the challenges:

In her early twenties, Bessie moved to Chicago. Perhaps there she could "find a bigger life." In the city, Bessie heard many tales of World War I from returned veterans. She also heard there were woman airplane pilots in France. From then on, she was determined to become a pilot. But she soon found out that no one would teach a woman -- especially a woman with dark skin -- how to fly. To study in France was her only chance, and by working hard and saving her money, she managed at last to get there. Bessie Coleman became the first African-American to earn a pilot's license. She was somebody.

After releasing four albums, the mainstream finally discovered Prince with this album. Not only was the song “Little Red Corvette” being played on pop radio stations, it was also being played on rock stations. When it came to black folks loving rock music, Prince was the guy to look up to. Also, the album marks the beginning of mainstream media calling Prince a rock star.
Riding a tricycle down a very tall, very steep hill. Actually, that part turned out ok. It's the part at the bottom that gets a little rough.

The final product is a CD, DVD, or MP3. None of those formats are analog. I like using old instruments and amps, but it will always end up digital in the end. If there is frequent data loss and errors. . . drink less or learn more.
Happy Mother's Day to all of you BEAUTIFUL women!
The Tuanku also hit out at Hindraf leaders for claiming that “ethnic cleansing” occurred in Malaysia, saying that it was an outrageous claim, which had damaged Malaysia’s image.
No, nothing has the power to part me from you; our love is based upon virtue, and will last as long as our lives.
In Iwate Prefecture, three small breweries have reported no damage, and are continuing operations as usual. However, Iwate Kura Beer has reported a ruptured fermentation tank, which will cause them to stop operations for about a month. However, there were no injuries to any personnel.

After my work out I went to the little mall for a bit and saw something scary. A little girl got her shoe string caught in the escalator. She was about 7 years old and her shoe was untied and when she got to the end of the escalator, her string just went into one of the slats and she was stuck. She stood there, confused and inefectually yanking her leg like she was a bear in a bear trap, but her mom was really cool, just bent over and reversed it out, no fuss no muss. The little girl howled and hollered afterward and her mom was like "What is your deal? Jeez, calm down! That was no problem!" I thought the mom handled it well, all told. Norwegian moms are really laid back, I like the way they tend to handle their kids.
Don't worry there was more. "Cause there's a chance he dropped the knife that was used."
Mr Sheridan asked the witness if the solicitors for the NotW had been cooperative, DCS Williams replied he had “no reason to think otherwise”.

Exactly as before, the match staff were efficient, welcoming, and friendly and remembered us from our last shlep to the range in February.
Stormy Skies is my favourite - well it was to begin with, then most of the others tied for 1st equal! A gorgeous greyed pastel blue with fine glitter that glows green most of the time. Every now and then I see the glitter shining yellow & blue too! I think there might be some fine shimmer in SS as well. This was a 2 coater also & it applied beautifully; but it dries a gritty so top coat is a must to get it to shine. I love staring at the photos of SS!!!!!
“I know of your purpose here,” The centaur repeated, shaking his magnificent head so that his hair danced around him. “And I shall take you to where it grows.” He spoke no more, but broke into a canter and Alice found herself drifting heavily into a sleep despite her not being in the least bit tired. She could not keep her eyes open.
There were thousands of people protesting against them today in the center of Athens.
One of the other best bits of the weekend was meeting so many other suppliers, bloggers and wedding industry folk that I have spent so long chatting with over twitter and facebook ... finally getting to meet them in person was lovely!

When we talked with Sameer he was too reluctant to narrate the incident. The main gate of the house was locked securely and had not been disturbed at all.
Form thoughts into sentences and type them out. Even if I’m repeating, “I don’t know what to write. I can’t think of a thing. I just feel anxious. AGAIN. Blah blah, that’s boring. I can’t write about that again. I should go to bed. But what if I can’t sleep? I might as well sit here. At least then I’m not panicking about not being able to fall asleep…” etc. Classic application of the adage, “Begin where you are.” Sitting at my kitchen table, unsold dozens of eggs from today’s market all around me, my stomach growls from too much adrenaline and too little food. (Yes, that’s literally where I am.)
And Brain, how dare you? Sleep and I try to get along. We’ve made up. I’ve taken Sleep out to dinner. To the movies. Bus rides. Sleep wanted to hang out so bad once upon a time that I called her up while I was changing the baby’s diaper.

An affirmation is a declaration of something that's true; an affirmation prayer is a religious or metaphysical technique that focuses on a positive outcome instead of a negative one (thanks, Wikipedia!). While "prayer" is a term I shy away from, because I dislike anything that has religious connotations, I think of an affirmation as being a collection of positive thoughts that sees you through hard times, and I think it's important for everyone to have one.
I am the mother of two beautiful, adult kids who make me so incredibly proud with the choices they've made in their lives. Some of those choices might not have been what I would say were the best at the time they were made, but all turned out okay, and to this day they still blow me away with their awesomeness.
Yeah, maybe not. BUT - I have a plan for finding homes for all of these lovely ladies.
Father God, I love You so much today. Thank You for Your Word which is truth and water to my soul. Search me, know me and guide me in the way that I should go as I stay focused on You and planted in Your Word in Jesus name. Amen.

We started on King street (one of the main arteries of the city that is known for its fantastic shopping), putzing in and out of stores, shopping, exploring and wandering.
I am not sure I will ever do a regular manicure ever again. Even though they run you about $35, it is a much better investment to have a long lasting, chip free manicure. What do you all think? Do you love Shellac too?
Pushing aside the fact that the size of one's tits certainly do not maketh the woman, it is very hard not to become enraged at the horrible treatment this woman was subjected to - and hard not to admire her gall. For any non-American, such as myself, who has little knowledge of American history, Angelou's book is terribly educative.
As for me, well, so-so…I am ALIVE and I am BLESSED so I really shouldn’t complain. But since my surgery back in feb 2010, my body has not been the same…I have been back and forth to the doctors and surgeons trying to find out WHY I am continue to have gastro issues…I have had colonoscopies, blood work, scopes, etc and they still don’t’ know what is going on. I wonder if they injured something while they did the surgery…anyway, I just wanted it FIX cause it is LIFE ALTERING what I am going thru…my fibro is kicking my butt too, but again, with all the stress of the surgery and now with matthew seizures, my little body is going nuts!

The morning was full of sighs and ennui, Internet time wasting, and some half-hearted soul searching. I listened to the rain, drummed my fingers on the table. I went off the rails a bit, not really sure of what to do next, what obstacles I should try to remove. It then hit me hard: it was now just over three months since I was let go from my job. Three. Months. And no prospects, yet, for a new one.
Next up is another stealth project. I can show you a sneak peak of it.....

You will note that there is some wiggle room in these statements. It is “almost certain” that humans are responsible; nasty things will “probably” happen. That is because all science can ever be is the best guess of the best minds. Also, the climate is a complex system, meaning it can behave in ways that are opaque beyond our most sophisticated calculations. But, as I have often been told, those statements are as true as any scientific statements can be, and nobody — I repeat, nobody — has been able to refute this. In short, to deny any of these statements is to put yourself beyond the bounds of rational discourse.
Serving and former US Navy SEALs have slammed President Barack Obama for taking the credit for killing Osama bin Laden and accused him of using Special Forces operators as ‘ammunition’ for his re-election campaign. The SEALs spoke out to MailOnline after the Obama campaign released an ad entitled ‘One Chance’.
The story begins a little slow with the introduction of Margaret, a sort of lame biographer who works in her father's bookstore. Margaret's big break comes when she is contacted by Vida Winter, a super-star author who has always been enigmatic about her life. She decides to finally tell the truth about her history, and contracts Margaret to pen the story. They meet and Ms. Winter begins telling her tale.

"She's an impulse buyer. She sees a vase, a tea set, an embroidered pillow and simply has to have it. When she gets home, she feels guilty for splurging on something she didn't need, so she skips lunch for a week to pay herself back. Basically, she never eats lunch."
It helps you to understand why the Taliban and the ANSF both seem to want to kill American troops and the Afghan population might be very keen for ISAF to leave. This thoughtful and well-written piece by Neil Shea for “The American Scholar” discusses the issue of war crimes and atrocities and is based on the author’s time embedded in a US infantry platoon in the summer of last year. It reads like an updated screen play of Oliver Stone’s classic war film, “Platoon”. In fact it reads like an updated version of pretty much all the Vietnam war films I have ever seen. A couple of the most depressing moments to give you a flavour:
