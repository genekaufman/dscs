Our changing stateColorado's 1960 population was 1.8 million; now we've passed 5.1 million. The state covers 66.3 million acres, or 104,247 square miles. Forty-two percent of that is public land — city, county, state and national. In 1962, we had 39.9 million acres of privately owned farms and ranches creating the legendary Western landscape; today it's 31.3 million acres. We've lost 8.6 million acres of ag land, the open space we crave, and food producers. (A hopeful note: more than 1.8 million acres of open space, primarily farms and ranches, are now protected by conservation easements against development.)
Moe joined luncheon guests in dropping daisies -- symbol of a POW's military code of silence-- at Tri-C's POW memorial. He snapped off a quick salute as his flower fell, and a black POW/MIA flag fluttered overhead in its own silent tribute.
The move could either bolster Rubio's appeal to be Romney's running mate at a time when the presumptive nominee is struggling mightily with Hispanic voters. Or it could lead to a divisive internal debate within the GOP and wound the rising star's standing on the right.
Jackson countered that the teachers’ collective bargaining powers will not be weakened. The school district still has to negotiate with the Cleveland Teachers Union, as well as all other bargaining units that are part of the district. In fact, those discussions already are occurring, he noted.

Kansas player who must be locked down: Kansas point guard Tyshawn Thomas was playing on a right knee that required surgery soon after the Jayhawks' win over Ohio State on Dec. 10, when he had nine points, 13 assists and seven turnovers. He's looking to be that much better today. "I think a lot of people forget that I was hurt when we played the first time," Taylor said. "I was playing with a big brace on my knee, which is really uncomfortable. I wasn't 100 percent. From Dec. 10 till now, I think I'm a completely different player."

For Lee, the agreement comes amid harsh criticism at home that his response to a deadly artillery attack last month by North Korea on a South Korean island has been weak and indecisive. His government, which once had said it would not renegotiate the trade deal, could face harsh criticism at home if the compromises on autos are seen as a capitulation.

Quevedo proved he wasn't only about silver bikini bottoms -- he covered up his female models in interestingly shredded sweater knits, and a pair of quilted balmacaans with matching miniskirts were nicely done.
Counter-terrorism experts also suggest the assassination plot may be linked to an internal power struggle in Tehran between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate control over the Quds force. Given the high level of professionalism of most previous Quds operations, the clumsy way this plot was carried out — almost as if it were intended to be discovered — has led to speculation that it could even have been a deliberate attempt by the Khamenei faction to embarrass President Ahmadinejad and undermine his authority. In the wilderness of mirrors that characterizes Iran's fractured political structure, it may prove impossible to figure out the motivation of all the various players or the rationale behind their actions.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Unfortunately, the Bucs legacy stopped here...
We understand Stanton's dilemma, but residents also are facing potential hefty state and federal tax increases, as well as inflation as seen every time one fills up a car's gas tank. Government should not cost more than the people's ability to pay. Increasing the city's tax burden actually could hurt Stanton, rather than help it.
How an obvious computer error escalated into a security breach that caused so much trouble for an 89-year-old man is baffling, but it happened, and it could happen to anyone as the Transportation Security Administration tightens its boarding-pass review process.
The deficits have been driven higher by the lingering effects of the worst recession since the 1930s. About one-third of the higher deficits in this period are a result of a drop in government tax revenues.

For all the headlines that the Greek crisis generated, Spain is potentially a much bigger problem. Greece makes up about 2 percent of the gross domestic product of the 17 countries that use the euro, but Spain makes up 11 percent.

Adam: When CM Punk walked into last year’s “Money in the Bank” as a villain, he received the loudest reaction of any fan favorites that night. Now, he’s returning home in the fight of his life against an opponent who has dragged him down a dark path of memories. The crowd reaction for this match should be insane, and the booking seems right for Punk to give the crowd just what they want to see.
Kucinich failed to win a majority vote on that matter when the House took it up, but support for his position was shared by nearly 150 House colleagues.

Because Austria was slow to recognize that it was more a Nazi ally than a victim, some of the doctors suspected of complicity in the killings worked as renowned researchers into the 1970s, based in part on their activities during the Hitler era.
They're wrong. The abandonment of the case management system is a barely tolerable defeat — not for one side or the other in some obscure struggle for control between local trial courts and central administration, but for Californians who are entitled to, and have been paying for, a judicial system that serves their needs with modern facilities and accessible, up-to-date technology.

Apple's domestic tax bill has piqued particular curiosity among corporate tax experts because though the company is based in the United States, its profits -- on paper, at least -- are largely foreign. While Apple contracts out much of the manufacturing and assembly of its products to other companies overseas, the majority of Apple's executives, product designers, marketers, employees, research and development and retail stores are in the United States. Tax experts say it is therefore reasonable to expect that most of Apple's profits would be American as well. The nation's tax code is based on the concept that a company "earns" income where value is created, rather than where products are sold.

University officials stress that they won't start project until they identify the necessary funding.

I appreciated state Rep. Paul Thissen's April 11 counterpoint ("GOP's lips say 'yes' to jobs; actions say 'no').

The airport checkpoint as we know it today sprang into existence in spring 2002, over a month and a half at Baltimore/Washington International airport. New demands on the system after 9/11, like an exhaustive manual check of all carry-on bags, had left checkpoints overwhelmed by long lines and backlogs. A team of management consultants from Accenture delved into the minutiae of checkpoint activity at BWI: How long did it take to pass from one point to another? How did the behavior of travelers affect line speed? How were people interacting with the equipment?

Wallace and Valdez have been imprisoned for 11 years -- in separate cells (rendered with a suitably squalid minimalism by scenic designer Cameron McFee) near enough for conversation -- and systematically brutalized to no end that they can surmise. “I mean, what kind of place is it, Wallace, where they torture you and they don’t even want to know anything?” Valdez asks. “I’m no longer sure,” Wallace replies. “If there was such a thing as an engine that ran on human agony, I’d say that’s where we were.”

The governor has not said what he will do next, but his options are limited. He could try to place the tax extensions on the ballot without the Republican votes needed for a two-thirds majority, but that approach is legally questionable. He could try to gather signatures to put the taxes before the people via a ballot initiative, but if he does that, the temporary taxes will expire before the vote, so he would be asking for tax increases rather than merely preserving the status quo. That's a much tougher sell.

Workplace: A nondiscrimination clause would prevent employers from firing or disciplining workers who used marijuana unless an employer could prove that job performance was impaired. Pre-employment testing would be banned. Conflicts with federal law abound. For example, the feds require operators of planes, trains, trucks and buses to be removed from their jobs if they test positive for any narcotic.

If a left tackle who is an excellent value is available at 19, I'd have no problem if the Bears selected him. I don't suspect that will be the case, however. There probably are three offensive tackles worth taking that high -- Matt Kalil of Southern Cal, Riley Reiff of Iowa and Jonathan Martin of Stanford. My hunch is all three will be off the board by the time the Bears pick, and better values will be available at other positions. The Bears' swing tackle in 2012 very well could be Chris Williams, or, if Williams wins a starting offensive tackle job, the swing tackle could be Webb. Either way, at this point it looks like Williams is moving back to tackle.

What everyone can agree on is that we were not exactly built to sit. "We were built to stand, to move, to walk," said James Levine, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist who is so fanatical about not sitting at work that he walks at 1 mph all day on a treadmill at his desk.
This year, state lawmakers, corporations, hospitals, media partners and many residents in New Jersey will be unified in their support of Blue and Green Day.

And the judges at the world competition found all this pretty impressive, awarding the team second place in research behind Team Toxic, also from the U.S.
In a sense, the difficulty of distinguishing between spiritual and political leadership is what "Superstar" was always about. That makes the show a canny choice for this primary season, when the religious views of certain presidential hopefuls have aroused uneasiness in several quarters — Newt Gingrich for what he has said in the past; Mitt Romney for what he hasn't.

Despite this, Americans aren't notably healthier than people in other advanced countries, the study reports. Life expectancy in the United States (78.2 years) lags behind Japan's (83 years) and the OECD average (79.5 years). It roughly equals Chile's and the Czech Republic's, says Mark Pearson of the OECD. Americans don't have much to show for their system's enormous cost, even if the gaps in life expectancy partly reflect differences in lifestyle and diet.

The elevated dining room/kitchen area is the homeowners' favorite place in the home. Feldner loves to cook and appreciates the high end appliances from Whirlpool and Electrolux, including those that provide energy-saving induction cooking. Stainless steel appliances "show some scratches, but it also means the kitchen is used," according to Psenicka.
BART's rail cars are unique and costly for a number of reasons, including their lightweight design, which requires aluminum shells instead of stainless steel; a power system using more voltage to provide faster acceleration; wider tracks, presumably to provide a smoother ride; and sturdier parts to handle BART's higher speeds and quicker acceleration.
Q: The greater point is about the role of women in kitchens. What does Middle America not know about female chefs?

In some cases, the directors gave their stars confidence. (Judy Garland, always crushingly insecure, never looked lovelier or acted more confidently than in the pictures made by her husband, Vincente Minnelli.) In some cases, they dialed that cockiness back a bit (only William Wyler truly knew how to keep Bette Davis in check).
He doesn't confine his skills to St. Charles.
A. Gardeners can grow good lemons when the winter weather cooperates. If the winter weather is warm or uniformly cool, lemon and lime trees can be good survivors. When there are sudden freezes or temperatures dip much below the upper 20's the trees are going to be damaged. Thus, it does seem wise to grow these trees in containers to move to warmer spots during the really cold weather.
Berggruen insists that's not the case. "I've been very upfront with Michael. I've been very, very transparent. I want this to end up with LACMA, but LACMA should not be one person's efforts; there should be four or five people who really contribute to give it the depth and critical mass and texture it needs to be really vibrant. If that happens, my donation makes sense. If it never gets there, it won't," he calmly explained that day at LACMA.

While Acta is trying to keep the rotation together, it was rumored Thursday night that the Indians were close to trading for veteran outfielder/DH Bobby Abreu of the Angels. The Indians and Angels definitely talked, but the deal has grown cold. Antonetti is still determined to improve the roster. If you've been following the Indians and their quest to score runs in the Arizona desert, you know why.
In a genre that rushes to reward conformity and market mediocrity, "outlaw" country performers always emerge to put the grit back in the music. In decades past, Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, Haggard and Cash have done it. In the 1980s, it was Lyle Lovett, Dwight Yoakam, Guy Clark and Steve Earle who brought me back to the music.
As we have learned in recent years, partisan brinksmanship does not tend to yield the best policy solutions. The longer Congress waits to take action and the more Medicare is used as a political weapon, the harder it will be to save and strengthen Medicare.
now seems like a long shot. The Congress party-led government tried to make that policy change last year, but was forced to undo it when critics from opposition parties and its own ruling coalition said the move would crush small-time shopkeepers.
Civil service also sets up often cumbersome rules to fire current employees, Keefe said. The tool kit proposals would also consolidate the disciplinary process, considering both minor and major infractions in the same forum.

James Ziglar, who was head of the old Immigration and Naturalization Service from 2001 until it was folded into DHS in 2002, said immigration authorities made efforts to locate immigrants thought to be a threat to national security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But simply having overstayed a visa wouldn't have made illegal immigrants like El Khalifi a priority.
Protect your fruit trees from sunscald. It is not uncommon for midwinter's grip to ease long enough to allow sap to rise. When temperatures drop again to freezing, the tree cambium dies on the exposed west side, halting the passage of water and nutrients where the cambium has been damaged. Cover the first couple of feet of your fruit trees' trunks with a tree wrap or white exterior latex paint with a bubble wrap cover, or use pipe insulation to keep the cold at bay.

The Gamaa's nod to Abolfotoh followed a more important endorsement over the weekend from a group that is just as radical — the ultraconservative Dawa Salafiya and its political arm Al-Nour party, which leads a bloc that controls nearly 20 percent of parliament's seats. Al-Nour, like the Gamaa, advocates the implementation of a strict interpretation of Shariah laws that many view as unfair to women, minority Christians and secularists.
-- Some resorts or hotels base their "regular" rate claim on their high-season price, even when the sale price is limited to off-season visits. That well may be the case in my example: The high-season price for a junior suite at the Caribbean property involved (in mid-February) is actually $306 per night. But November is the middle of the slowest quarter of the year for all Caribbean destinations, and just about everybody there is pushing very low off-season rates.

A: If I want something they don't agree on, I fund it separately on my own. Responsible giving is a very tough thing to do well. You have to do your homework. We hire a part-time person. We have site visits, interviews with the people, get follow-up reports. The worst thing we can do is give (to) people and not expect anything back. It's so important to help people help themselves.

The three films demonstrate the variety of comedy. "The Artist" is a nearly silent, lighthearted romance set in the late 1920s and early '30s. "Midnight" is a time-traveling fantasy laced with literary and artistic allusions and "Bridesmaids," a box-office champion with $288 million in worldwide grosses, is a bawdy farce.

The question is hardly isolated to PacifiCorp. Utilities across the country have already canceled plans to build more than 150 new coal plants in the past four years, according to the shareholder activist group As You Sow. A 2010 study by The Brattle Group, a Boston-based consulting outfit, found that 20 percent of the coal generation capacity in the nation could be retired if currently contemplated mandates are passed. The study estimated that compliance costs for plants that stay open could total $180 billion.
"The ratings we got yesterday, it really speaks to the anticipation of what is going to be a great Daytona 500 and a great season," Goren said. "The challenge tonight as far as ratings is we are in the middle of February ratings sweeps, and there are significant successful shows on other networks. The question becomes, ‘will the loyal NASCAR audience find us?' The casual fan seems to have caught on Sunday for the storylines and the season, but the casual fan who was with us yesterday, now in primetime, has other options.

To make the zest, use a sharp citrus stripper to peel long strips from a lemon. Make sure you get only the yellow peel, as the white pith underneath is bitter. If you do this in advance, cover the zest with a damp paper towel and plastic wrap so the lemon curls do not dry out before you use them.
Words, for once in his life, were scarce and softly spoken. He waved at fans who recognized him in the airport. He merely smiled and shook his head in disbelief when asked if baseball was really serious about using replacement players.

"Today's posturing makes it clear that the company and the auto task force would rather discount the thousands of individual investors and retirees who own GM bonds than undergo earnest negotiations," a committee of GM bondholders said in a news release. The group said the 10 percent offer was "neither reasonable nor adequate."
I wrote last week that it's been a tough run for the sports teams in this state lately. We get caught up, too often, with the bottom line, and forget to notice there are big moments going on all around us.

In technology, size isn't always an asset, as HP is learning. One of the biggest challenges for Whitman will be to figure out how big HP needs to be. It's a key question that has tripped up a string of CEOs, from Carly Fiorina and her hard-fought battle to buy Compaq Computer, to Mark Hurd and his $20 billion acquisition spree and 50,000 job cuts, and Apotheker's poorly received plan to steer HP away from lower-margin areas of computer hardware.
