Our changing stateColorado's 1960 population was 1.8 million; now we've passed 5.1 million. The state covers 66.3 million acres, or 104,247 square miles. Forty-two percent of that is public land — city, county, state and national. In 1962, we had 39.9 million acres of privately owned farms and ranches creating the legendary Western landscape; today it's 31.3 million acres. We've lost 8.6 million acres of ag land, the open space we crave, and food producers. (A hopeful note: more than 1.8 million acres of open space, primarily farms and ranches, are now protected by conservation easements against development.)
Moe joined luncheon guests in dropping daisies -- symbol of a POW's military code of silence-- at Tri-C's POW memorial. He snapped off a quick salute as his flower fell, and a black POW/MIA flag fluttered overhead in its own silent tribute.
The move could either bolster Rubio's appeal to be Romney's running mate at a time when the presumptive nominee is struggling mightily with Hispanic voters. Or it could lead to a divisive internal debate within the GOP and wound the rising star's standing on the right.
Jackson countered that the teachers’ collective bargaining powers will not be weakened. The school district still has to negotiate with the Cleveland Teachers Union, as well as all other bargaining units that are part of the district. In fact, those discussions already are occurring, he noted.

Kansas player who must be locked down: Kansas point guard Tyshawn Thomas was playing on a right knee that required surgery soon after the Jayhawks' win over Ohio State on Dec. 10, when he had nine points, 13 assists and seven turnovers. He's looking to be that much better today. "I think a lot of people forget that I was hurt when we played the first time," Taylor said. "I was playing with a big brace on my knee, which is really uncomfortable. I wasn't 100 percent. From Dec. 10 till now, I think I'm a completely different player."

For Lee, the agreement comes amid harsh criticism at home that his response to a deadly artillery attack last month by North Korea on a South Korean island has been weak and indecisive. His government, which once had said it would not renegotiate the trade deal, could face harsh criticism at home if the compromises on autos are seen as a capitulation.

Quevedo proved he wasn't only about silver bikini bottoms -- he covered up his female models in interestingly shredded sweater knits, and a pair of quilted balmacaans with matching miniskirts were nicely done.
Counter-terrorism experts also suggest the assassination plot may be linked to an internal power struggle in Tehran between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate control over the Quds force. Given the high level of professionalism of most previous Quds operations, the clumsy way this plot was carried out — almost as if it were intended to be discovered — has led to speculation that it could even have been a deliberate attempt by the Khamenei faction to embarrass President Ahmadinejad and undermine his authority. In the wilderness of mirrors that characterizes Iran's fractured political structure, it may prove impossible to figure out the motivation of all the various players or the rationale behind their actions.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Unfortunately, the Bucs legacy stopped here...
We understand Stanton's dilemma, but residents also are facing potential hefty state and federal tax increases, as well as inflation as seen every time one fills up a car's gas tank. Government should not cost more than the people's ability to pay. Increasing the city's tax burden actually could hurt Stanton, rather than help it.
How an obvious computer error escalated into a security breach that caused so much trouble for an 89-year-old man is baffling, but it happened, and it could happen to anyone as the Transportation Security Administration tightens its boarding-pass review process.
The deficits have been driven higher by the lingering effects of the worst recession since the 1930s. About one-third of the higher deficits in this period are a result of a drop in government tax revenues.

For all the headlines that the Greek crisis generated, Spain is potentially a much bigger problem. Greece makes up about 2 percent of the gross domestic product of the 17 countries that use the euro, but Spain makes up 11 percent.

Adam: When CM Punk walked into last year’s “Money in the Bank” as a villain, he received the loudest reaction of any fan favorites that night. Now, he’s returning home in the fight of his life against an opponent who has dragged him down a dark path of memories. The crowd reaction for this match should be insane, and the booking seems right for Punk to give the crowd just what they want to see.
Kucinich failed to win a majority vote on that matter when the House took it up, but support for his position was shared by nearly 150 House colleagues.

Because Austria was slow to recognize that it was more a Nazi ally than a victim, some of the doctors suspected of complicity in the killings worked as renowned researchers into the 1970s, based in part on their activities during the Hitler era.
They're wrong. The abandonment of the case management system is a barely tolerable defeat — not for one side or the other in some obscure struggle for control between local trial courts and central administration, but for Californians who are entitled to, and have been paying for, a judicial system that serves their needs with modern facilities and accessible, up-to-date technology.

Apple's domestic tax bill has piqued particular curiosity among corporate tax experts because though the company is based in the United States, its profits -- on paper, at least -- are largely foreign. While Apple contracts out much of the manufacturing and assembly of its products to other companies overseas, the majority of Apple's executives, product designers, marketers, employees, research and development and retail stores are in the United States. Tax experts say it is therefore reasonable to expect that most of Apple's profits would be American as well. The nation's tax code is based on the concept that a company "earns" income where value is created, rather than where products are sold.

University officials stress that they won't start project until they identify the necessary funding.

I appreciated state Rep. Paul Thissen's April 11 counterpoint ("GOP's lips say 'yes' to jobs; actions say 'no').

The airport checkpoint as we know it today sprang into existence in spring 2002, over a month and a half at Baltimore/Washington International airport. New demands on the system after 9/11, like an exhaustive manual check of all carry-on bags, had left checkpoints overwhelmed by long lines and backlogs. A team of management consultants from Accenture delved into the minutiae of checkpoint activity at BWI: How long did it take to pass from one point to another? How did the behavior of travelers affect line speed? How were people interacting with the equipment?

Wallace and Valdez have been imprisoned for 11 years -- in separate cells (rendered with a suitably squalid minimalism by scenic designer Cameron McFee) near enough for conversation -- and systematically brutalized to no end that they can surmise. “I mean, what kind of place is it, Wallace, where they torture you and they don’t even want to know anything?” Valdez asks. “I’m no longer sure,” Wallace replies. “If there was such a thing as an engine that ran on human agony, I’d say that’s where we were.”

The governor has not said what he will do next, but his options are limited. He could try to place the tax extensions on the ballot without the Republican votes needed for a two-thirds majority, but that approach is legally questionable. He could try to gather signatures to put the taxes before the people via a ballot initiative, but if he does that, the temporary taxes will expire before the vote, so he would be asking for tax increases rather than merely preserving the status quo. That's a much tougher sell.

Workplace: A nondiscrimination clause would prevent employers from firing or disciplining workers who used marijuana unless an employer could prove that job performance was impaired. Pre-employment testing would be banned. Conflicts with federal law abound. For example, the feds require operators of planes, trains, trucks and buses to be removed from their jobs if they test positive for any narcotic.

If a left tackle who is an excellent value is available at 19, I'd have no problem if the Bears selected him. I don't suspect that will be the case, however. There probably are three offensive tackles worth taking that high -- Matt Kalil of Southern Cal, Riley Reiff of Iowa and Jonathan Martin of Stanford. My hunch is all three will be off the board by the time the Bears pick, and better values will be available at other positions. The Bears' swing tackle in 2012 very well could be Chris Williams, or, if Williams wins a starting offensive tackle job, the swing tackle could be Webb. Either way, at this point it looks like Williams is moving back to tackle.

What everyone can agree on is that we were not exactly built to sit. "We were built to stand, to move, to walk," said James Levine, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist who is so fanatical about not sitting at work that he walks at 1 mph all day on a treadmill at his desk.
This year, state lawmakers, corporations, hospitals, media partners and many residents in New Jersey will be unified in their support of Blue and Green Day.

And the judges at the world competition found all this pretty impressive, awarding the team second place in research behind Team Toxic, also from the U.S.
In a sense, the difficulty of distinguishing between spiritual and political leadership is what "Superstar" was always about. That makes the show a canny choice for this primary season, when the religious views of certain presidential hopefuls have aroused uneasiness in several quarters — Newt Gingrich for what he has said in the past; Mitt Romney for what he hasn't.

Despite this, Americans aren't notably healthier than people in other advanced countries, the study reports. Life expectancy in the United States (78.2 years) lags behind Japan's (83 years) and the OECD average (79.5 years). It roughly equals Chile's and the Czech Republic's, says Mark Pearson of the OECD. Americans don't have much to show for their system's enormous cost, even if the gaps in life expectancy partly reflect differences in lifestyle and diet.

The elevated dining room/kitchen area is the homeowners' favorite place in the home. Feldner loves to cook and appreciates the high end appliances from Whirlpool and Electrolux, including those that provide energy-saving induction cooking. Stainless steel appliances "show some scratches, but it also means the kitchen is used," according to Psenicka.
BART's rail cars are unique and costly for a number of reasons, including their lightweight design, which requires aluminum shells instead of stainless steel; a power system using more voltage to provide faster acceleration; wider tracks, presumably to provide a smoother ride; and sturdier parts to handle BART's higher speeds and quicker acceleration.
Q: The greater point is about the role of women in kitchens. What does Middle America not know about female chefs?

In some cases, the directors gave their stars confidence. (Judy Garland, always crushingly insecure, never looked lovelier or acted more confidently than in the pictures made by her husband, Vincente Minnelli.) In some cases, they dialed that cockiness back a bit (only William Wyler truly knew how to keep Bette Davis in check).
He doesn't confine his skills to St. Charles.
A. Gardeners can grow good lemons when the winter weather cooperates. If the winter weather is warm or uniformly cool, lemon and lime trees can be good survivors. When there are sudden freezes or temperatures dip much below the upper 20's the trees are going to be damaged. Thus, it does seem wise to grow these trees in containers to move to warmer spots during the really cold weather.
Berggruen insists that's not the case. "I've been very upfront with Michael. I've been very, very transparent. I want this to end up with LACMA, but LACMA should not be one person's efforts; there should be four or five people who really contribute to give it the depth and critical mass and texture it needs to be really vibrant. If that happens, my donation makes sense. If it never gets there, it won't," he calmly explained that day at LACMA.

While Acta is trying to keep the rotation together, it was rumored Thursday night that the Indians were close to trading for veteran outfielder/DH Bobby Abreu of the Angels. The Indians and Angels definitely talked, but the deal has grown cold. Antonetti is still determined to improve the roster. If you've been following the Indians and their quest to score runs in the Arizona desert, you know why.
In a genre that rushes to reward conformity and market mediocrity, "outlaw" country performers always emerge to put the grit back in the music. In decades past, Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, Haggard and Cash have done it. In the 1980s, it was Lyle Lovett, Dwight Yoakam, Guy Clark and Steve Earle who brought me back to the music.
As we have learned in recent years, partisan brinksmanship does not tend to yield the best policy solutions. The longer Congress waits to take action and the more Medicare is used as a political weapon, the harder it will be to save and strengthen Medicare.
now seems like a long shot. The Congress party-led government tried to make that policy change last year, but was forced to undo it when critics from opposition parties and its own ruling coalition said the move would crush small-time shopkeepers.
Civil service also sets up often cumbersome rules to fire current employees, Keefe said. The tool kit proposals would also consolidate the disciplinary process, considering both minor and major infractions in the same forum.

James Ziglar, who was head of the old Immigration and Naturalization Service from 2001 until it was folded into DHS in 2002, said immigration authorities made efforts to locate immigrants thought to be a threat to national security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But simply having overstayed a visa wouldn't have made illegal immigrants like El Khalifi a priority.
Protect your fruit trees from sunscald. It is not uncommon for midwinter's grip to ease long enough to allow sap to rise. When temperatures drop again to freezing, the tree cambium dies on the exposed west side, halting the passage of water and nutrients where the cambium has been damaged. Cover the first couple of feet of your fruit trees' trunks with a tree wrap or white exterior latex paint with a bubble wrap cover, or use pipe insulation to keep the cold at bay.

The Gamaa's nod to Abolfotoh followed a more important endorsement over the weekend from a group that is just as radical — the ultraconservative Dawa Salafiya and its political arm Al-Nour party, which leads a bloc that controls nearly 20 percent of parliament's seats. Al-Nour, like the Gamaa, advocates the implementation of a strict interpretation of Shariah laws that many view as unfair to women, minority Christians and secularists.
-- Some resorts or hotels base their "regular" rate claim on their high-season price, even when the sale price is limited to off-season visits. That well may be the case in my example: The high-season price for a junior suite at the Caribbean property involved (in mid-February) is actually $306 per night. But November is the middle of the slowest quarter of the year for all Caribbean destinations, and just about everybody there is pushing very low off-season rates.

A: If I want something they don't agree on, I fund it separately on my own. Responsible giving is a very tough thing to do well. You have to do your homework. We hire a part-time person. We have site visits, interviews with the people, get follow-up reports. The worst thing we can do is give (to) people and not expect anything back. It's so important to help people help themselves.

The three films demonstrate the variety of comedy. "The Artist" is a nearly silent, lighthearted romance set in the late 1920s and early '30s. "Midnight" is a time-traveling fantasy laced with literary and artistic allusions and "Bridesmaids," a box-office champion with $288 million in worldwide grosses, is a bawdy farce.

The question is hardly isolated to PacifiCorp. Utilities across the country have already canceled plans to build more than 150 new coal plants in the past four years, according to the shareholder activist group As You Sow. A 2010 study by The Brattle Group, a Boston-based consulting outfit, found that 20 percent of the coal generation capacity in the nation could be retired if currently contemplated mandates are passed. The study estimated that compliance costs for plants that stay open could total $180 billion.
"The ratings we got yesterday, it really speaks to the anticipation of what is going to be a great Daytona 500 and a great season," Goren said. "The challenge tonight as far as ratings is we are in the middle of February ratings sweeps, and there are significant successful shows on other networks. The question becomes, ‘will the loyal NASCAR audience find us?' The casual fan seems to have caught on Sunday for the storylines and the season, but the casual fan who was with us yesterday, now in primetime, has other options.

To make the zest, use a sharp citrus stripper to peel long strips from a lemon. Make sure you get only the yellow peel, as the white pith underneath is bitter. If you do this in advance, cover the zest with a damp paper towel and plastic wrap so the lemon curls do not dry out before you use them.
Words, for once in his life, were scarce and softly spoken. He waved at fans who recognized him in the airport. He merely smiled and shook his head in disbelief when asked if baseball was really serious about using replacement players.

"Today's posturing makes it clear that the company and the auto task force would rather discount the thousands of individual investors and retirees who own GM bonds than undergo earnest negotiations," a committee of GM bondholders said in a news release. The group said the 10 percent offer was "neither reasonable nor adequate."
I wrote last week that it's been a tough run for the sports teams in this state lately. We get caught up, too often, with the bottom line, and forget to notice there are big moments going on all around us.

In technology, size isn't always an asset, as HP is learning. One of the biggest challenges for Whitman will be to figure out how big HP needs to be. It's a key question that has tripped up a string of CEOs, from Carly Fiorina and her hard-fought battle to buy Compaq Computer, to Mark Hurd and his $20 billion acquisition spree and 50,000 job cuts, and Apotheker's poorly received plan to steer HP away from lower-margin areas of computer hardware.

Without resorting to Wellesian cinematic techniques for telescoping character into convenient rosebud epiphanies, the movie, and especially Barrie himself, somehow feels shallow, mysterious and inscrutable. Or maybe it's just that we Americans want it all explained for us, wrapped up in a convenient package with shiny ribbon, and it was Welles who discovered the screen language that would do the trick.

The vibe: Think "Cheers" when you hear this restaurant's name. Why? Well, it is the type of place where they know everyone by name. The restaurant is filled with warm and inviting colors, mahogany wood and plenty of windows to let in the sunlight, giving you a very San Francisco-like feel.

While the rest of the industry gave ground, Cake held fast: "Showroom" sold very close to the number of albums "Pressure Chief" did seven years ago. McCrea considers it appropriate that "Showroom" was the lowest-selling No. 1 album in the history of the Billboard charts. They’ve made it to the summit with gloom, pessimism ("Every shiny toy that once brought you joy/Will soon begin to cloy and annoy" is a typical lyric from the new set) and a modest, self-effacing sound. Where other rock guitarists strum power chords, Cake’s Xan McCurdy — one of the true six-string originals working in contemporary pop — picks out scratchy lines and tiny, funky, broken chords. In the place of screaming solos, multi-instrumentalist Vince DiFiore blows tasteful trumpet leads.

Well, under questioning by Trung attorney Steve Baric, Registrar Neal Kelley said one of the steps in the "original" system of voting is that a voter with an electronic ballot must look at a printed version of his vote and confirm it is accurate before making the selection final by electronic means. Kelley also said that during the actual election, a manual audit was ongoing to ensure accuracy. Neither step was taken in the recount. Under questioning by Deputy County Counsel Leon Page, however, Kelley stood by results that currently have Janetwinning by seven votes. Tests of the electronic system showed it to be 100 percent accurate and every ballot that was counted on Election Day was counted during the recount, he said. Baric will argue that in a literal reading of the law, the recount was not done by "original" means.

Peeta asks Donald if he knows anything about the quickstep. Given his display of "DWTS" superfandom last week, I'm sure he does. Peeta says she's given Donald a very hard routine. In rehearsal, Donald drops into a split (impressive!) and them comes up wincing (ouch!). This song, "Stay the Night" by James Blunt, starts out so slow -- I hope it picks up or their quickstep is going to look really weird. Donald's kicks and flicks are high and high-energy.

Tom points out that this admission may be a first from Len.

Each time that he has (gone) out I've seen his command improve.”

Now, wearing underwear backward isn't that big of a deal (except that he is always picking his ill-fitting under garments out his rear) but when he wants to wear his pants or shirt the wrong way round, we start to have problems. I had to sit him down and tell him a few things, "First of all, jeans are not made to be worn that way, and it's hard to walk with the zipper in the crack of your butt. Second, when you dress up that way, people give your parents very strange looks and your parents have to spend a lot of time explaining things to random nosy people at the store. Things like, 'No, I am not punishing my child with public humiliation' and 'Because he wants it that way!' and that gets old. And thirdly, haven't you noticed that it's hard to go to the potty when you wear you pants like that?"

I learned that sometimes smaller jobs can be appreciated more than working on big building projects. Two years ago, a New Jersey Realtor referred a client to me to see if I could help them to update bathrooms in a house that they wanted to sell. I took it on without hesitation, sketched it out and wished them all the best. We gutted two bathrooms and put in new toilets, sinks, tile, sconces, fans, vanities and faucets. The changes helped them to sell their house.

They also agreed on the grave danger posed by Iran's nuclear aspirations and that a policy of "containment," whereby the international community reconciles itself to an Iran capable of building nuclear weapons but seeks to limit its impact, is not an option. Both spoke of how nuclear capability would enable Iran not only to threaten Israel, but also to endanger the world's oil supply, propel a nuclear arms race in the region and supply nuclear weapons to radical factions that could be detonated anywhere, including Western countries. As President Obama said, "The entire world has an interest in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon." And he fully understands that "No Israeli government can tolerate a nuclear weapon in the hands of a regime that denies the Holocaust, threatens to wipe Israel off the map and sponsors terrorist groups committed to Israel's destruction."

So when questions are raised about MetroHealth, ask yourself why we are not talking about health care for the poor. Ask how we can get more people covered with access to care. Ask how we can make health insurance premiums more affordable in this region. Ask how we keep the third-poorest location in the nation livable for our neighbors and ourselves.

This month marks the 100th year anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. To commemorate, the film "Titanic" (released in 1997), has been released in 3-D, IMAX and digital 2D formats in theaters. With this rerelease I have mixed emotions. It's a good idea for the movie to be rereleased in IMAX and digital 2D because many teens my age want to experience the movie in theaters, which is the way many say it should be seen. And huge fans of the Titanic now get the chance to see it clear and in high definition. Also, since the movie is three hours long, I'd like to watch it without being distracted every 30 minutes. I have never watched "Titanic" straight through; I've only watched it in separate segments at different times.

Some things have changed, of course. Gone are stables for guests' horses; the school, movie theater, billiard room and bowling alley that were once downstairs; and fox hunts that were staged in nearby barren hills.

Annie is as engaging as she is generous, full of opinions earned by living life at full throttle, even when she was scared to death. And that is a crucial truth about Annie Glenn. Americans rightly "ooh" and "ahh" over John Glenn's courage in space, but let us never forget the hero of a wife who gave her public blessing, and then privately prayed until his safe return.

I vaguely remembered having heard about this worthy effort in the past. But what made it extra-special was that my local Weight Watchers location was doing a bit more than just participating in the national campaign. They took the added step of choosing a local food bank to support. They are encouraging members to bring in canned goods at every weigh-in; some people are trying to match their amount of weight lost with the amount of food they bring in. "Lost 20 pounds this year? Bring in 20 pounds of food for those who need it." That kind of thing.

Jonathan Turley is probably not the most popular man right now with supporters of same-sex marriage. The George Washington University law professor has filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of Utah's anti-polygamy laws — and his argument is based on a landmark 2003 Supreme Court gay rights decision. That's not good news in the view of most gay rights supporters, who don't want their cause linked to that of polygamists any more than they want to see parallels drawn with people who engage in incest, bestiality and other taboo sexual practices.
Hey, Greg: Mitchell's demise was a broken finger in training camp. It robbed him of the chance to move up the depth chart. Once the regular season begins and all attention is focused on preparing for the next game, it's extremely difficult for a young player to work himself back into prominence unless an unforeseen circumstance (injury, trade, etc.) opens the door of opportunity.
DeCroce was born in Morristown in 1936 and graduated from Boonton High School before attending Seton Hall. DeCroce was selected to fill a vacancy and sworn in to his Assembly seat 1989.

I drove in Friday from the far Southwest Side because it was Opening Day for the White Sox. I drive the Dan Ryan Expy. regularly, and it just hit me - like a ball lost in the sun - what a great thing it is that the Dan Ryan was redone eight to 10 years ago, or whenever that was. What an enormous success it has been. You can drive in during rush hour at a normal clip, 30 minutes from 111th Street to Chinatown at 8 a.m. is incredible. Thanks to all those who planned and designed and had the vision to make it happen.

"What is the parade of horribles?" asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor, if the court were to decide the penalties were not a tax and the health care case went forward?

There’s this little crystal cube called the Tesseract from the world of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). “I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose,” he declares, in a line of glorious awesomeness. Everyone wants the Tesseract because it’s a portal to the other world and/or a potential source of limitless power.
French, however, doesn't go for the cheap, tabloid sell. He cites numerous sources and even researches which cocktails were served at which bars.

Fitting the Ravens: The Ravens expect Pro Bowl free safety Ed Reed to play in 2012, so finding a replacement isn’t an immediate need. But it’s something they should soon take care of given Reed’s injuries and his past statements about retirement.

Prosecco tends to be simpler, with frothier bubbles caused by its mechanical method of carbonation, known as Charmat. Cava undergoes secondary fermentation in the bottle, the expensive method used in Champagne, and also often has toasty aromas from primary fermentation in oak barrels.
Supporters of Proposition 29 say that voters want to see a strong relationship between a special tax and how it's spent. Cigarettes cause cancer, heart disease and lung problems, so it makes sense to use the tax to find out more about those diseases. To paraphrase "Thre Mikado," whose "object all sublime" was to "let the punishment fit the crime," the idea is that the object must be to let the benefit fit the tax.

Bronson asked him to explain the term.
It's kind of my own thing, but I do look at things like the blogs for new ideas and inspiration. I'm told I should be working in fashion. I just helped my sister plan her wedding; I'm good at it. I don't like to be boring; I like to create an outfit. An outfit for me starts with a tank top, preferably one with a print. I like color, texture. Then I add a sweater or something, skinny jeans and great shoes or boots. If I don't do an outfit quite right, it affects my mood. Good colors and prints make me smile.

In the first full quarter since blockbuster cholesterol pill Lipitor lost U.S. patent protection, its sales fell 71 percent in the U.S. and 42 percent worldwide, to $1.4 billion. But big discounts to insurers and patients helped retain a third of the market, far more than usual. Pfizer has two potential blockbusters awaiting approval. — AP

KGO also is unlikely to report on the doings of the departed hosts. At press time, two of the seven who were let go Dec. 1 had landed new jobs, and two others were in touch with various stations. (Besides Gross and Rothmann, pink slips went to Gene Burns, Len Tillem, Ray Taliaferro, Joanie Greggains and Dr. Bill Wattenburg.) On Tuesday, Tillem, the attorney who does his weekday advice show out of Sonoma, began broadcasting on the new KKSF (910 AM), from 3 to 4 p.m. He was followed by Burns, whose program goes from 4 to 7 p.m., and whose weekly "Dining Around" show will air on Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., as it had on KGO since 1995.

Early experiences taught Keller to treat each ingredient with care and respect. He recalls the time he accidentally snapped the leg of a rabbit when he reached into the cage to grab it and didn't have a proper grip. He still remembers the squeal of pain, but that gruesome incident became a defining moment in shaping his approach to food -- every element is treated with dignity, and cooked in a way that celebrates it. Keller is one of the most thoughtful and precise of chefs, and it shows in every preparation. He's so exacting and particular that he has designed just about every plate and serving piece in the restaurant. About a year ago, he raised his menu price from $115 to $175, and recently also added an automatic gratuity, which is split among the staff -- much as Chez Panisse has been doing for years. While the price is formidable, with Keller's culinary genius and Laura Cunningham's front-of-the-house magic, the experience is well worth the extra dollars. The menu changes anywhere from 30 to 60 percent a night, depending on what's fresh that day.
Rival games and the postseason are a bad mix if you're not prepared. Good teams have bad days and get sent home every year. While the district field isn't as loaded as some others, Walsh knows that on any given night your season will end.

The Rams rolled over Branham 16-0 last week, crushing 18 hits in the win. John Riley smashed the ball all over the yard, ripping a double, a triple and a pair of singles. James Hatano proved to be too much for the Branham pitchers, too, belting three hits in his three at bats. He also drove in two.

Woody Harrelson has a small, sour role as Jango, an ex-rocker turned organic-yogurt magnate. James Liao has more fun than you'd expect in the eventually preposterous role of Al, the too-hip son of the Chinese restaurant's owners. Fred Ward is Mike's father, a withdrawn Vietnam vet, and Margo Martindale -- she played the poignantly gauche American tourist in "Paris, je t'aime" -- is Mike's mother, who says of Sue at one point, "She's logical, in an emotionally annihilating way." The line is too elaborate for the character, but then the plot is too sprawling for the structure. That's often the way with debut films: so many notions, so little time.
The Cavaliers suffered their worst home loss in the franchise's 42-season history, falling, 114-75, to the Chicago Bulls in front of 17,871 fans. The 39-point margin of defeat eclipses the old mark of 35 set twice, most recently on March 20, 2001, against the New York Knicks (110-75).

September is a crucial time for teachers, and, having retired after 37 years of teaching, I knew I would be feeling the pull of the classroom when autumn arrived. So I decided instead to spend my September days in one of America's most stunning settings, Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. I had followed the reintroduction of the gray wolf into the West from Canada since the mid-1990s, and I knew the program had been extremely successful. I was determined to see wolves in the wild, so I signed up for the Fall Wolf and Elk Discovery program.
The monkey's hands were very soft, very velvety as they danced over my neck and shoulders. The creature was chattering gently, right next to my ear. Then it tugged. I tugged back. The monkey tightened its grip and pulled harder. Not exactly the story I'd planned to write: Padangtegal Ubud, Bali - Primate Garrotes Writer in Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary. But there I was in the surreally mystical refuge of macaca fascicularis - the Balinese or long-tailed macaque monkey - being strangled to death by two little hands and four shiny strands of red coral.

He begins with a letter dated 1915 from a man named Camille asking for a girl named Louise's hand in marriage. There are two photos of the same man taken 50 years apart, a postcard from a father to his daughter from the front lines of World War I, a rosary, a tiny calendar-diary and two calling cards.

The idea to have a city park honoring veterans first came up eight years ago when another Cornelius native, Spc. Kenny Leisten, was killed while serving in Taji, Iraq.

"I was hearing, not in a bad way, that 'He should go ahead and retire. He's had a great career.' I said, 'You know what? I'm not going to settle for that.' There's more left in the tank. There was nothing that motivated me more than going through this twice."

After 34 games in Portland, Felton has been another failed experiment rather than the Blazers' long-term answer at point guard. Felton is averaging a career-low 10.2 points per game, has committed 94 turnovers and is shooting a career-worst 37.6 percent from the field, including just 24.8 percent from three-point range. Felton lost his starting job in the Blazers' final game before the All-Star break and his name has started to be included in trade rumors.

Higgins is a true Portland classic. Greg Higgins has promoted restaurateur-farmer connections for years, taking on both roles when he grows vegetables, fruits and herbs for his establishment in his own garden. As a result the place serves some of the best vegetarian dishes in town. But the meat is not to be missed, and Higgins does wonders with its pates, in-house cured charcuterie, and especially a Tuscan "whole pig" plate. The restaurant can always be counted on to pair surprising ingredients with main dishes, as in rhubarb compote with duck, baked oysters with a nettle pesto, and fiddlehead ferns in an Italian bread salad. The lower level of the main dining room reminds one of a fine English club -- all wood and genteel class.

But others noted the pitfalls of relying on themselves to track their online financial statements – particularly when tax season rolls around.
A: Hey, @Victhequick: This is always worth explaining. Overall Big Ten record still matters most. If Ohio State wins out, including victories over Wisconsin and Penn State, the Buckeyes still would need the Badgers and Nittany Lions, both currently undefeated in conference play, to lose one other game.

We've had criers sometimes, too, Ty says. (Criers are isolated, offered a drink and then told to chill out.) Learning how all the pieces move can be real frustrating for a little kid.
A combination of higher cost-of-living adjustments and sluggish growth in wages is pinching the fund right now. The report released Monday said reserves would be exhausted by 2033, three years sooner than projected last year. The outlook for Medicare was roughly the same as the previous year. However, that program requires major repairs to remain afloat as the cost of health care rises and the population ages. Together, Social Security and Medicare now account for about a third of the federal budget.

In 2012, Athens' debts are projected to reach 172.7 percent of gross domestic product, while the deficit will drop to 6.8 percent.
The popularity of Mr. Bo's programs had raised the prospect such policies could gain traction nationwide, which could have clouded prospects for what economists say are needed reforms in China.
Saturday afternoon, referee Karl Hess ejected two former N.C. State greats — former NBAer Tom Gugliotta and Chris Corchiani — from the Wolfpack's game against Florida State. Hess refused to answer why he tossed two fans from the game. That's just another example of the officials flexing their muscle, but with no accountability. We're not asking that all officials — the majority of whom do an excellent job under tough circumstances — explain every decision, but there needs to be a system put into place where questions can be asked or things explained. It will make everyone's lives much easier. In the instance on Saturday, what is the harm in explaining why Gugliotta and Corchiani were tossed? Or more commonly, where is the downside in giving the reasoning behind a disputed foul call at the end of a game? There is none. Officials — like coaches and players — should enter the realm of having a forum answer tough questions when the situations call for it.
Let’s tell our citizens the truth—today—right now—about what failing to do strong reforms costs them.
Portland residents may decide the costs are well worth the benefits. The city has many excellent schools and many improving ones, even under today's conditions. With schools in disarray, Portland is less able to attract and retain good employers, less able to graduate productive citizens, less able to maintain its quality of life. As most major American cities have learned the hard way, it's almost impossible to get the schools back once they're gone.
Motorists must stop for the officer, but they don't have to participate in the real-world survey that can include a 10-minute smog check. Colin, you were likely waved through because the state had tested enough vehicles like yours.
Operating under the theory that it is no crime for one patient to share medicine with another, all the marijuana — whether in the food or at the hash bar — is free. And unlike the marijuana cafes in Portland, there is no membership fee.
A man who'd offered the nurses room in a ski lodge in exchange for some light cleaning entertained them during the day by lining up their brand new cowboy hats and shooting a hole through each one. They'd never be proper cowgirls without that badge of honor, he'd told them. After a few too many drinks that night, he delivered tea to their room and, with a gun to Gwenda's head, insisted they drink.
What will this organization offer local parents?
Though some employees have already left for other jobs, others are stepping up to take on more responsibility. But hiring enough temporary workers to fill in the holes has been a challenge, Nnanabu said.

Mayor Maxwell agreed with the concept.
As the years passed, Michael and I continued documenting the story of America's marginalized populations. In 2008, we realized we had to pull our decades of work into a book that made sense of the economic dislocation.
I'd never accuse the good rangers at Pinnacles National Monument of pulling a bait-and-switch, but they did have to recently perform some serious family counseling in order to keep a condor couple's maternity plans on track.
A week earlier he had introduced his Welfare Reform Act of 2011, which would require a full accounting of each social welfare program. It also would require food stamp recipients to work or prepare for a job, much as welfare reform under President Bill Clinton required of cash aid recipients. And it would require federal welfare spending to return to pre-recession levels, with allowance for inflation growth, once the unemployment rate fell to 6.5 percent.
The Chicago department has been trying to upgrade its tactics and procedures for years. A department that failed to adequately train, equip or even feed officers during the 1968 convention takes pains to make sure mistakes of the past are not repeated.

When it became clear that the Baltimore Grand Prix was in financial ruin and wouldn't be able to pay the city millions it owed in taxes and expense reimbursement — not to mention millions more it owed to the state and to assorted vendors — former Baltimore Racing Development CEO Jay Davidson took to The Sun's op-ed page to pin the blame on the lack of subsidies from the city. He suggested that Baltimore waive the fees it was charging the race organizers in exchange for a bigger share of the eventual profits.

A stretch of Gravois Road in Howard's ward is dotted with a medley of global restaurants, groceries and businesses. Since 1998, Crosslin said, refugees have opened or expanded nearly 300 small businesses in St. Louis. Those businesses have made an impact of more than $100 million on the region in the form of patronizing local suppliers, job creation, and spending profits in the community, Crosslin said.
The outbreak of the Civil War forced officers to choose sides. Unlike Robert E. Lee, Mansfield remained loyal to the Union. His technical skills, wealth of experience and personal vigor more than compensated for his relatively advanced age. He was promoted to brigadier general in May 1861 and was initially put in charge of the forts defendingWashington, D.C.
With two of the American League's top pitching teams dueling it out for a third straight day, Kila Ka'aihue blooped a winning single in the 14th inning soon after Cespedes' tying two-run homer, and the A's rallied past the Chicago White Sox 5-4 on Wednesday.

Yet U-M co-captain Zack Novak stressed after Friday's game that the accomplishments should be appreciated.
"His imprint is certainly on both teams," Coyotes coach Dave Tippett said. "Both teams should be very grateful for the imprint that he's left."
By then, it was the early 1980s, and she had found a new cause, a form of exercise she was starting to do that she turned into the "Workout," which grew into a series of aerobic and strengthening videos. So she channeled her anxiety into sometimes-punishing physical exercise.
The state's defense, and it has been around the block in other cases, is that one General Assembly (which sits for two years, beginning in the January of every odd-numbered year) can't bind the next General Assembly. So, for example, the 2009-10 legislature (the current one) can't necessarily require the 2011-12 legislature to do anything (as Ohio school spenders are about to find out).

Montrose's restlessness spilled over into his music. He dropped out of Van Morrison's band after helping record and tour "Tupelo Honey." He quit the Edgar Winter Group after the release of hits "Free Ride" and "Frankenstein." He even pulled apart his own band, firing Hagar after they made two classic rock albums together, 1973's "Montrose" and 1974's "Paper Money."

As Dimora stared from across the courtroom, Kleem avoided making eye contact with his onetime friend as he described how their relationship became so close that he would greet the commissioner with a hug and a kiss, a display of affection that helped send a message.
Descalso, who also has started at shortstop and third base this spring, isn't the ideal leadoff man because he doesn't have much basestealing speed. But Descalso does have a .434 on-base percentage with a team-high 12 walks and a .294 batting average, despite going nothing for four Thursday.
Before returning to the judge's table, Cardoz shares a nice moment with the captain he cooked for. The soldier thanks him for the meal, and gives him a commemorative coin in honor of a job well done. The gesture moves Cardoz to tears, ushering in another round of waxing about the honor of cooking for returning servicemen.
Playing cards, fresh flowers and a map or guide to local attractions are among a few finishing touches you might consider to complete the space.
Samuel Dickson was 17 years old, almost a man, that April night in San Francisco 100 years ago. He and a friend had gotten standing-room tickets for the opera and heard the great Caruso sing.

Nor are there any signs that Stein ever spoke out against Vichy's anti-Semitic laws - certainly not during and not even after the war. Nor did she take steps to help any of the figures in her prewar circle who ended up deported to death camps.
Sepler cited many factors contributing to the avalanche of irksome actions:
"I'm in a good place now and I'm here talking with you to reassure folks of Oregon, that I'm taking care of my family, my young kids, and my 88-year-old mom who is staying with us, she's really taking care of us."
It's also important to Capt. Jon Anderson, who also just returned from Kuwait, his second deployment. Anderson has two boys, Lincoln, 17 months, and Emmitt, who is just 10 weeks old. His wife, Christina, has shouldered the burden of raising the two toddlers herself.

Manahan denied a motion by Morris County Assistant Prosecutor Joseph D’Onofrio to revoke Hopler’s firearms ID card, which would have meant he couldn’t possess any weapons.
So, yeah, there’s a Ben Stiller comedy (“Neighborhood Watch”) another self-promoting Tyler Perry movie (“Tyler Perry’s The Matchmaker”) and further who-asked-for-‘em sequels to “Ice Age” and “Step Up.” Oh, and “Ted,” a twisted comedy with Mark Wahlberg and a talking teddy bear that sounds like “The Beaver,” only less so.
Anyway, as long as things are changing, she figures, who better to be pictured on the new money than Skynyrd.
I love mocking, which is why I have produced five first-round mock drafts in the past two months (and it’s why I have greeted your criticism of said mock drafts with an aw-shucks shrug of the shoulders). In my latest first-round mock, which was released Tuesday night, I had the Ravens selecting Alabama linebacker Dont’a Hightower with the 29th pick in the NFL draft. Why stop there? How about I project all eight of their picks?
Now, poker players are an eccentric and suspicious breed, harder to talk to than cops ('And cops are who we're tryin' to avoid,' says Wayne Lowe, an Alabama gambler who was on hand for the Super Bowl of Poker at Caesars). You might say getting ahold of Slim was like 'tryin' to put a wildcat in a tobacco sack.'

Although Oregon's dry side was bypassed by the oil and gas boom that roiled the West in recent years, it's clear that won't be the case with wind. That could change the view from atop Steens Mountain or on Interstate 84 while driving toward Boise. But it also portends some bitter fights over who gets to use publicly owned land and for what purpose.

A week later, some energy staffers staged a minor rebellion, convinced that the state's intervention in the R.W. Beck contract was improper. Lorena Wise, the department's designated procurement officer for the contract, and two others said they would refuse to sign the document. Wise ultimately signed the document, but she told investigators it was under duress.
Dimora is a primary target in a federal investigation that has gone on for more than four years -- but became public in July 2008 -- in Cuyahoga County.
Doctors can include professional and community awards they've received and information about their research or publications.
Jamming a government health care takeover through the House of Representatives using stealth, deception, trickery and just plain bald-faced lies woke up the saner elements of the nation to the fact that -- wow, they really won't stop at anything.
Chinese consumers are so used to bootlegs that particular pirate "brands" with names like Red Dragon, Monkey King and Pegasus have loyal followings. Some of the more established pirate brands are experimenting with watermarks of their own, in an effort to distinguish their products from those made by smaller bootleg outfits. The high-end pirates don't deal in copies of movies recorded in theaters with shaky hand-held cameras; rather, they make bootleg copies of authentic DVDs, known as D9s, that often offer more features than an authorized DVD of the same movie sold in an American Wal-Mart. Some brands put together exquisitely packaged box sets or collectors' editions.
Burke ran the race in 1940, disguised as a man because women weren't allowed to participate.
How to use it: Tangerine Tango is a powerful color and can overwhelm in large doses. Pantone's color specialists suggest incorporating orange into patterned home accessories. Orange pillows, bedspreads and vases make a statement without overpowering a room.
Now, we have made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste. Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse. We’re selling acres of federal office space that hasn’t been used in years, and we will cut through red tape to get rid of more. But we need to think bigger. In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America. I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote – and we will push to get it passed.
The cameras cost $336,000, most of which was paid for through federal technology grants obtained in 2008, DeMaio said. While the cameras have been installed in patrol and traffic cruisers, DeMaio is seeking additional grants to equip the rest of the department’s fleet.
During their 1974 tour of South Africa, the British & Irish Lions were not going to be intimidated — in fact, quite the reverse. When a player was targeted by the Springboks, he would shout "99," a call to arms for Lions players, triggering a mass retaliation by his teammates. The Lions' thought process: "If the referee sends one of us off, he'll have to send all of us off." It worked. In one of the most violent rugby matches ever — later christened "The Battle of Boet Erasmus" — there is famous footage of Lions full-back JPR Williams running halfway down the field to launch himself at Johannes van Heerden. There were scuffles all over the field, sparked by the "99" call.
William O' Grady, executive vice president and chief market strategist for Confluence Investment Management of St. Louis, is even more pessimistic. He said he doubts the crude oil released from U.S. reserves will even go to U.S. refineries.
Faced with more nights on the street, Brown said he thought lofting the brick through the building would give him at least a few hours in a place where "someone's going to offer me a sandwich and drink."
And Slay's not the only one calling for this. The same idea came
The passage of SB 1070 may have been inevitable. Arizonans are fed up over the federal government's foot-dragging in bringing about the kind of immigration reform that secures the southern border, deals with those individuals who are already in the country illegally and gets serious about how to handle those immigrants who will come here in the future. But while the debate over SB 1070 is a necessary one, it's sidetracked us from what should be Arizona's priority: generating jobs. With a statewide unemployment rate hovering just south of 10 percent, our state's leaders need to regain focus at this critical time. Arizona has to get back to work. When we should be debating the best path to economic growth, we've instead been left to contemplate canceled conventions and wrongheaded boycotts.
Not so with Pizzetti. His Petrarch triptych had a much wider emotional compass, of which Filianoti took full advantage.
Tester's note: The spare ribs are bulky; I needed to use two Dutch ovens.
8. Ahhhhh!: I took a nice cold shower at Sweetbriar after a sweltering 18 holes on the Legacy Course. Even though it provided some comic material for Shaw, it was worth it! (And frankly, a few of those guys could have benefited from one also).
The product comes packaged in a rearview mirror that will replace the vehicle's original mirror. The FMV mirror is slightly bulkier than most original ones, and it features several buttons and indicators.
In North Carolina, pollster Tom Jensen told the News and Observer that a majority of North Carolinians actually support some legal recognition for same-sex couples. But he added that "opponents of the amendment had an uphill battle in convincing voters that it was anything other than a referendum on gay marriage, even though it does go a lot further than that" by forbidding civil unions and domestic partnerships.

“The easier part of Italy’s bond auctions this week took place earlier today,” Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York, wrote in a note today. “But a good test of the appetite for Italian debt will be tomorrow’s bond sales that have maturities past three years.”
The three largest center-left parties, Labor, Kadima and Yesh Atid, together are expected to capture about 40 seats, according to recent polls. Netanyahu could invite some or all of them to join him. None of these parties has ruled out a partnership with Likud.
Finally, in July, Stubblefield wrote a memo to Bryson that outlined what had clearly become a strained relationship.

Delaney, who was endorsed by former President Bill Clinton and the Washington Post, defeated state Sen. Rob Garagiola, a rising star in Annapolis who had the backing of Gov. Martin O’Malley and a number of other prominent Maryland Democrats. Some believe the district, which was redrawn to favor Democrats in the general election, was carved with Garagiola in mind.
Olson says no one suspected Breivik, who was in police uniform as he stepped onto the ferry some two hours after setting off a car-bomb in central Oslo that killed eight people.
The players were out after a curfew imposed by the coaching staff when the fight took place. However, LSU athletics spokesman Michael Bonnette said players traditionally conclude fall camp, which ended last Thursday, by socializing together after curfew.

It remains riveting television, no doubt. You can't take your eyes off three-time Emmy winner Bryan Cranston's Walt White, the former dutiful dad and chemistry teacher who turned his scientific know-how into a thriving drug business. He just can't stop breaking from bad to worse, sacrificing bits of his soul in increasingly alarming chunks.

In mysterious disappearances, Ryan is now listed with Ameila Earhart, D.B. Cooper, Jimmy Hoffa and Charlie Sheen's career.
The web of who worked where, who paid a kickback or took a bribe and who is cooperating in the probe is tangled. It's sometimes hard to remember who has been charged, who has pleaded guilty and how long they might be locked up for their deeds.
Several states, including Florida, rewrote unemployment laws to tighten eligibility and make it easier for businesses to challenge an employee's right to jobless benefits.
But a report released Sunday by the state and city comptrollers says MTA needs to do a better job of keeping straphangers informed about changes that affect their rides. The report by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli and New York City Comptroller John Liu found that projects that disrupt subway lines often go over budget and that New York City Transit's efforts to publicize the service changes are inadequate.

Tharp had previous felony convictions for aggravated battery, theft, burglary and fleeing.
Under this “tiered” system, the paradigm is development as opposed to exclusivity – something I much prefer. There is a lot of benefit to making NXT the first stop, Smackdown the land of opportunity and Raw (to steal a phrase from WCW) “where the big boys play.” Most importantly, this system doesn't require a draft ... not in the traditional WWE definition we are used to anyway. Instead of trades, why not a sports-style draft where shows like NXT and Smackdown get populated with new faces, complete with scouting reports and flashy video packages that educate us on why we should care about this individual?
Mayor Frank Jackson is calling for shared sacrifice. He is seeking concessions from the city's unions in order to close a projected $23 million budget gap this year.
"I felt looking at our team we had a lot of very good players," Armstrong said. "The stage I felt we were at was rearranging some of the pieces ... It was time to move some of those pieces around to get more of what I believed was a team that could compete now and in the future."
øMayweather even praised his opponent as a "true warrior, a tough champion", and said, "to go into the Hall Of Fame you have to face the best opponents," which, for Cotto, cannot be denied. He has faced Manny Pacquiao, Antonio Margarito twice, Shane Mosley and Zab Judah.

A bond the EFSF issued earlier this month to fund part of its bailout for Ireland, for instance, required a much higher premium to garner enough investor interest. And even since the issue, the bond has lost value. Friday, on the Luxembourg bourse, it closed 3.4% below the price at which it was issued.

I'm trying to be patient because she's 30 and her own person, but I can't help but feel having a financial responsibility (the house) makes it even more important to make the relationship legal - for tax reasons, if nothing else.

While training was a focus of the Bush administration, experts said that it should be broader and become a standard part of the law enforcement curriculum for every officer in a position to encounter human trafficking.
WEEK 10
I thought we couldn't afford matching furniture or Hummel figurines, and that my mom was too tired to create those snow-scenes on the windows. But I grew up to realize that my mother had something better than money; she had taste. She painted and sketched and made clothes so beautiful that after her memorial service, one of my sister's friends wept as she told me about the elegance of the French seams my mother put inside a formal she'd sewn for her as a gift. Today, years after she's gone, my brother, sister and I have my mom's paintings on the walls of our homes.
Besides, Heath Ledger got his expected nomination for best supporting actor and the film got eight other nods in technical categories.
WESTLAKE, Ohio -- Nordson Corp., a maker of dispensing and testing equipment, said it made $55.3 million, or $1.61 a diluted share, in its third quarter, a 131 percent improvement from a profit of $24 million, or 71 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.
President Obama has been criticized -- including in a Times editorial -- for his ahistorical statement that it would be "an unprecedented, extraordinary step" if the court overturned "a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress." The law in question, of course, was "Obamacare," and the president seemed to be trying to muscle the court into upholding it by lamenting "that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law." That was unseemly.
"They are going from building to building looking for any of the troops left but I think everyone has left already," he said.

Consider this: Both procedurally and factually, no reason existed for the court to even get involved. No case was pending before it. Instead, a federal appeals court had simply presented the court with a question about state law.
There were noticeable slights and some welcome surprises. Leonardo DiCaprio was not nominated for Best Actor for "J.

What's especially disheartening is that we've seen all of this before, and we know how it ends.
Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat, recently took the opportunity of a Daily Beast interview to say that Romney's father, George, was "born into (a) polygamy commune in Mexico." (Mitt Romney's grandfather, Gaskell, had one wife, but his great-grandfather, Miles Park Romney, had four and fled to Mexico in 1885 to escape U.S. anti-polygamy laws.)
The local Romney delegate contests are assisted by about $150,000 raised by the "Committee to Elect Delegates," created last year by Rutherford's team, to help pay for district specific mailings and other campaign material and research to find "high propensity" Romney voters.

The company was caught in a stock-option manipulation scandal that forced it to restate three years of earnings while ousting three top executives. Among those implicated was longtime Chief Executive and Chairman Amnon Landan, who in the previous three years made $3.85 million in salary and bonus, and sold $13.2 million worth of stock.

The announcement of the population by the governors of Maryland and Virginia was upbeat but with a healthy degree of caution.
One would assume that Holmgren and Heckert will not again follow the same pattern of inactivity. After all, trying again in 2012 with the 2011 cast will likely produce the same results. It's obvious that the Browns need to add at least one wide receiver; focusing on both an outside threat and a slot receiver. If such a strategy seems appropriate, then a combination of Jackson and Amendola makes sense. Jackson would instantly become the lone Browns' talent that would cause an opposing defense anxiety, while Amendola could benefit from the continual underneath dump offs that are a staple of Shurmur's offense. Additionally, both players have Cleveland ties. Jackson was drafted by a front office that included Heckert and Amendola was formerly coached by Shurmur.
Initial notices have been good. Ira Silverberg, literature director at the National Endowment for the Arts, praised the LARB for "providing a really good service and a great breadth of material." Dan Kois, editor of a new book review at the online magazine Slate, has been impressed by the array of writers and a nascent "West Coast thoughtfulness."
If we can agree that the 1962 Mets were the gold standard (or the zinc standard, perhaps) for ineptitude, there are several candidates for which one comes next. The 103-loss Worst Team Money Could Buy team of 1993 makes a strong case, thanks to their bleach spraying and firecracker slinging. The 2003-04 versions, brightened by Art Howe’s personality lighting up the room, demand a spot in the team photo. As do just about any team from 1963-67, though ’63’s 111-loss team which finished 48 games out of first place (and 15th out of ninth) merits special consideration.
Shoot First laws may have been an unnecessary rewrite to self-defense standards. Repeatedly, as they were being argued in Jefferson City, Topeka and other state capitols, gun advocates could not cite examples where people were unfairly charged and jailed after invoking self-defense.

The investors behind JHB Hotel have a signed letter of intent with an upscale brand, said Pete Whiskeman, a partner in the project. He declined to identify the brand but said the project would involve a 200-plus-room hotel, indoor parking and 12,000 to 13,000 square feet of ground-floor retail. The hotel would open in 2013, timed to the debut of the casino, the convention center and the medical mart, a planned showplace for medical devices.

Boyer says, "the drug they administered didn't have any FDA packaging" or other labeling to indicate what it was. The doctors performing the angiogram wanted "IC Green," which is a fluorescent dye that is used in angiograms. "Whoever was in the pharmacy just pulled it," Boyer said. Additionally, he noted, IC Green comes in a powder form, while the dye that Goodwin was injected with came in a vial, in liquid form.

Whedon writes with a perfect ear for each character's personality. What could have been a Babel of competing voices becomes almost musical counterpoint. There's Captain America's old-school idealism, Thor's flowery Elizabethan diction, and secret agent Black Widow's Bourne-like remorse for her ruthless past. Tony Stark's arch sarcasm, which wore thin in the previous Iron Man movie, is used here in effective small doses. When the robo-warrior grabs super-archer Hawkeye by the collar and warns "Clench up, Legolas" before jetting them both sky-high, the gag cracks like a bullwhip.

Although national and state Planned Parenthood officials say it’s too soon to predict how the expansion will unfold, the news arrives as a high-profile political debate unfolds over whether government should pay for family-planning services, which can include abortion.
"Because the release of the draft risk assessment and proposed risk management plan marks the beginning of our interaction with the public on these issues, we are continuing to ask producers of clones and livestock breeders to voluntarily refrain from introducing food products from these animals into commerce so that we will have the opportunity to consider the public's comments and to issue any final documents as warranted," said Sundlof.
Here he is in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11: "We are apparently supposed to shut up and eat our spinach. Asking questions, proposing alternatives, making distinctions, arguing analogies, remembering history, or criticizing our stand-tall President is, for the moment, unpatriotic and maybe even unmanly. Wave that flag, stuff that qualm." And yet, even in that moment, he can't stop looking to the writers, to literature as a counter-force. "Grace Paley, on the other wonderful hand," he enthuses a few lines later, "suggests … that we bomb Afghanistan with three tons of wheat, rye, and rice, since they are starving: 'If we do it with a vicious attitude, maybe that will be enough for some people.'"

I think Dave is incapable of stopping himself from following ideas that interest him. He doesn't have a brand he's worried about; he's not worried about a message; he's not interested in trying to create something that's going to be a blockbuster. Failure is an option, but only when you've done something that says, "This is the most honest thing we can put out there." So that allows us to make it as weird as we want because we believe in what we're doing.
“The sad part is we’ve invested so much in the California standards, but there are just too many of them,” Habermehl. “It’s a drawback to making the learning fun.

And as a result, St. Louis Public Schools could be forced to spend $175 million on tuition costs and about $134 million for transportation and special education services, according to Don Senti, executive director of Cooperating School Districts of Greater St. Louis.

Because this was a time before regulations prevented polluting of waterways, Jersey City developed for the towns a sewage-treatment plant in Boonton that was completed in 1925 and expanded in 1953. By the early 1960s, Jersey City sought payments to offset rising costs of treating sewage, but the towns refused. That led to a series of protracted legal battles and settlements periodically over the next 20 years.

Vancouver tied it at 1-1 on defenseman Alexander Edler's wrist shot from the point, which beat Jonathan Quick between the legs.
Indeed, Prince seems to covet the freedom afforded to jazz musicians who reinterpret their material nightly. His choice of support acts was telling: talented jazz bassist Esperanza Spalding and jazz-soul singer Hathaway. There was some head-scratching among fans when these names were announced, but Prince was sending a message -- come to the concert expecting stunning musicianship and something not unlike a jazz performance, and you won't be disappointed. And as strange as it was to hear scat singing in an arena, Spalding's too-brief set was a thrill. The bassist's four-piece jazz act simmered straight through their show, and Spalding's own songwriting was ambitious. Hathaway's set was sleepier, but had its exciting moments -- like her cover of Luther Vandross' "Forever, For Always, For Love," which climaxed in a guitar solo.

Indeed, from the moment the Yankees bowed out of the American League Division Series in October, losing a decisive Game 5 at home to the Detroit Tigers, Cashman said his one and only goal this off-season was to improve his team’s pitching. When it didn’t happen at the winter meetings, Cashman shrugged and preached patience. But as December turned to January, it was starting to look like the Yankees would head to Tampa with Sabathia and Nova followed by some combination of Phil Hughes, A.J. Burnett and Freddy Garcia. Now, it appears Hughes, Burnett and Garcia will have to battle for one spot. Or Hughes could return to the bullpen, where he excelled in 2009.

We did talk to a dentist who suggested that if you do try an over-the-counter teeth whitener, to make sure you include your dentist in the conversation so you can get proper guidance. There are sensitivity issues with some people and also a dentist can better direct where the whitening agent needs to be applied. Also, the dentist we talked to, Dr. Denton Kimbrough, said people with deep-seated staining of the teeth from years of coffee or cigarettes probably will not be helped by an over-the-counter teeth whitening product.

The libretto, steeped in the words of both Old and New Testaments, is fearless in drawing parallels among the stories of Lashaun, Abraham and Jesus.

The turn brought the As, which ostensibly was the exact card Gagne was looking for. But an ace was probably the only card that would cause her to lose her stack, since her freshly made straight was inferior to Juttelstad's. Not surprisingly, turning the straight inspired Gagne to move all in, leading to an instant call from Juttelstad that would make him the champion after the river came 8s. Gagne was doomed when the ace hit the board, and the only real strategic question is what's the best method of getting her money in. (Some would say she should check and give Juttelstad an opportunity to bluff, since he is almost never calling an all-in with a worse hand.)

Crowder knew Quarles was a resourceful psycho, Wynn Duffy (Jere Burns) warned Crowder that Quarles was a resourceful psycho, so what did Crowder do?

He's a chef who likes to cook and likes to eat. You don't need to know much more about him than that.

Let's not mistake incumbent-oriented politics with empowering politics, which is the engine of a healthy democracy.

As I've reminded throughout the years, the real story isn't about a holiday; it is about a holy day. It's about two people summoned from their home and forced to travel to register so the Roman occupiers could count them. The couple had no place to stay. One brief look, and the innkeeper announced there was no room at the inn. Their baby was born in the cold, in a working barn, set in a rough manger on a straw floor.

Is there a future for any NBA team with a split personality? The Lakers never seem to know exactly who they are, and the smart money has them falling short in the upcoming Western Conference semifinals, beginning Monday night in Oklahoma City.

Of all the fantastical scenes in "The Avengers" involving flying superheroes and gods from other planets and a flying, invisible aircraft carrier, perhaps the most logic-defying moment of all comes early in the film, when Scarlett/Natasha is tied to a chair but still manages to disarm and disable a roomful of bad guys. Even in 3-D and with the help of quick cuts and maybe a stunt double or two, this is one of the least believable tiny-actress-takes-down-sneering-bad-guys scenes in recent memory.
Hillsboro-based TriQuint Semiconductor, with 845 Oregon employees, makes components for wireless communication. It has added more than 800 employees company-wide since 2006, and plans to add about 160 more this year for a total 2,760.

Now, Oregon will tell you that it believes it has the greatest talent pool around. But the Ducks -- who haven't had a first-round selection since Jonathan Stewart in 2008 -- don't. And what we've learned in the past three seasons by watching the success on the field fail to translate into high-caliber NFL picks is that Kelly doesn't need all the best players to win big. He doesn't even need a half dozen of them. He just needs some pretty good football players, and maybe, a small number of guys who have a chance to play in the NFL someday.

What the Celts need most now is to try to convince themselves that just being in the Garden doesn’t mean an automatic two wins. They need to believe they’re locked in a series that could still go against them. Because they are.
The Democrats in Washington knew Obamacare would never survive an open debate with sufficient time devoted to unpacking everything lurking in its 2,000-plus pages.

GOP legislators would argue that HB 1617 would result in a tax increase. And a party that won't increase the nation's lowest state tax on cigarettes (to the detriment of individuals' health and the state's Medicaid budget) or collect taxes on online sales by out-of-state businesses (to the detriment of Missouri retailers) is not going to mess with any kind of tax increase whatsoever.

Consider packing just one carry-on-size bag (9-by-22-by-14 inches) and sharing an extra bag with your travel partner. I know — realistically, you'll be tempted to bring more. But cruising with limited luggage can be done without adversely impacting your trip; I've done it, and was happy I did. Pack one bag each, as if traveling alone, then share the third bag for bulky cruise extras (such as formal wear). If traveling before or after the cruise, you can store that third, nonessential bag at a friendly hotel or in a train-station luggage locker.

Making sure the kids get enough exercise in the summer months can be a challenge ("enough" being the amount it takes to tire them out so they don't have the energy to drive me crazy). During the school year they have gym and playtime with their classmates to tucker them out, and a trip down to the park can always take that extra edge off. But in the summer, parents have to find new ways to run the rug rats ragged because much like a bored golden retriever chewing up the entire house when left alone, if you don't exercise them, they will destroy everything and everyone you hold dear.

It is also important that the incoming president not only appoint people of differing philosophies, but that he's also willing to listen to their viewpoints as the governing process goes forward. Paul O'Neill may or may not have been the best choice for Treasury secretary in the first term of the Bush administration, but it really didn't matter that much. His own account of his tenure indicates that his principal function was to serve as a potted plant -- hauled out for photo opportunities when the administration wanted to make it appear that he supported its policies despite the fact that he had little input in developing them.

For two years, my family lived in the shadow of the city that is internationally known for being the birthplace of the original pizza -- Naples, Italy. While every city worldwide claims to have the "best" pizza, Napoli truly can boast this -- pizza margherita with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes, on a thin, nearly burned crust. It's simple but delicious. In March 2006, my mother traveled from the States to Italy to visit us and our 51/2-year-old son, Joshua. My mother, Joshua and I enjoyed a wonderful day trip from the Navy base in Gricignano to the island of Procida, just off the famous Amalfi Coast. The culmination of our trip? Dinner at a family-run pizzeria, where all the participants were fortunate to be able to make their own pizza from scratch, observe it baking in the famous brick pizza oven and then ultimately indulge in devouring their pizza. This is among my favorite memories of Italy. -- Elizabeth Krempasky, Strongsville

Kim was not eligible for the Masters. He is not exempt for the U.S. Open. Tuesday was the first time he hit balls since he withdrew from the Texas Open. After one swing, he clutched his right elbow.

While the Kirkland has all of the characteristics that make New Zealand sauvignon blanc unique, it's on the tamer end of the spectrum. A zesty, flavorful wine, it's much softer and easier to drink. It has a clean, minerally aroma with layers of zippy lemon, lime and grapefruit flavors. This is a crisp, medium-bodied white with a 13.5 percent level of alcohol and a refreshing acidity. It goes well with the pasta and asparagus recipe and also makes a good pair with fish and chicken.

While Rosenbaum comments on Christie's political future, his main agenda is to use Christie as a vehicle to deconstruct his own theories on the “authentic Jersey fat guy” persona – arguing that it was Tony Soprano (yes, the TV character) who paved the way for Chris Christie’s “keeping it real” grasp on voters’ hearts and minds. And in doing so, Rosenbaum misses a key point: Christie is effective.

That might seem to reflect badly on the employees who are now in paid limbo, many of whom are, no doubt, blameless and talented educators. Yet the investigation was going to continue, with questioning of all the staff. Students and their parents would have spent the semester wondering: Who's in trouble? Who can be trusted? That too makes it hard to get on with the business of educating. There might be no way to salvage a happy academic year for Miramonte, but Deasy is doing his best to make sure it's at least a safe one for students.

1965:
Where was I? Oh, yes: the world's all-time coldest wind chill. That's what you're going to be feeling at this point in an Obama second term. If you like his contempt for judicial review, parliamentary scrutiny and representative democracy now, wait'll you see how "flexible" he'll get starting in January 2013. The CFPB appointment is not a small thing. Indeed, its new director, one Richard Cordray, embodies what's gone so disastrously wrong with American government: you'll have to be in compliance with him, but he doesn't have to be in compliance with anybody, whether the Senate or the Constitution. As I say somewhere in my recent book, you don't need a president-for-life if you've got a bureaucracy-for-life. More and more aspects of the citizen's daily existence are regulated by rules and officials both of which are ever more disconnected from any meaningful accountability to the people's representatives. As the president says, look for even more "flexibility" in a second term: more non-recess recess appointments, more executive orders, more bewildering innovations from the commissars of the hyper-regulatory state.

In an attempt to grade success, The Plain Dealer matched draft lists with a decade of AP All-Pro teams from 2002 to 2011. That's a high bar to set -- finding an All-Pro -- but what NFL general manager wouldn't be thrilled with that outcome? Special teams players were excluded because most were undrafted free agents.

Pryce is careful to say that he wants no one to feel sorry for him, which is good because it'd be very difficult to. His days, he tells us, consist of working on his tennis serve and getting his kids to school and surfing the internet and then taking his dog -- yes, his dog -- to daycare. He says that he's still healthy and able to run quickly -- a rare, rare thing for a man who spent more than a decade in the NFL's trenches -- and that he is financially secure. He's a producer, the tagline of the column tells us, and the author of a forthcoming novel.

Whether the Democrats and Republicans like it or not, they are in bed together and may as well be married. Neither has a majority in both houses of Congress that can impose one-party rule. The filibuster provision in the Senate allows a minority to stymie the majority. The Constitution doesn't guarantee that political bedfellows will get along - there were no parties when the Constitution was written, and now we observe a marriage from hell. Unlike civil marriage, there's no chance for a divorce.

Seamus responded with diarrhea, and Mitt had to hose down the car when they stopped for gas.

The alternative term to "Joan trip" is, of course, "bucket list trip." But bucket list implies foreknowledge of some imminent dire consequence, which should not necessarily be the case.

The coal industry and its loyal servants in Congress are crying foul, and are pursuing a two-pronged strategy: seeking to pass legislation to block the proposed rule, and using it as political ammunition against President Obama by pretending it would kill jobs.

Robert Schumann called the work "a slender Grecian maiden between two Nordic giants" (i.e. the Third and Fifth symphonies), but Bell must not have got the memo.

The Texas Supreme Court has given us a needless opinion in which no one wins. The public, certainly, has lost.

C YOGI BERRA*: When I sketched out the 10-greatest list, I had Johnny Bench written in ink and was ready to move on to other positions. Berra's 10 World Series titles and 14 American League pennants drew back to his stats just to check. Obviously, that caused me to reconsider.

It's hard to pick against him at this position, except Berra's accomplishments are just as impressive. They seem to be hidden by his character, his quotes and his role with the Second Yankee Dynasty. Look for yourself:

"I thought we battled pretty hard and I think we deserved a little bit better than that," Elliott said. "But you've got to work for your chances. We had a lot of stuff from the outside and couldn't really get to the interior of the ice. We know what we need to do - it's just going out there and doing it. It was back-to-back (games) and it was a good team. We have to give them their credit, but next time we play them, we'll definitely be ready."

The Volcano Boat Tours operate daily, from early July through mid-September.

"I voluntarily stayed in the system because I have no other options," she says.

An impromptu meeting followed. Conversation about the Ben Stiller movie “Zoolander” intertwined, and by day’s end, they emerged as “Blue Steel,” an end-of-the-bench coalition that would soon demolish the common stereotypes associated with the role of a walk-on. (Blue Steel is the name given to a pose made famous by male model Derek Zoolander, the character Stiller plays in the film).

He takes us downstairs, where workers are finishing construction on Ginny's Supper Club (the room has just opened for business). The sleekly designed space will host different kinds of music - jazz and Latin, for example. Only this one, Samuelsson notes, "will have really good food."

In December, you may recall, Occupy Denver was also ejected from Civic Center west of Broadway, although not before they managed to deface stone balustrades and commit other acts of vandalism.

Brandon Roy had 21 points in 35 minutes and LaMarcus Aldridge scored 20.
That night, I Bixied back to the Plateau for dinner at La Banquise, Montreal's best known shop for poutine. This local specialty — French fries topped with gravy and cheese curds — is hearty, delicious and awesome with beer, though try as I might, all my photos made it look like dog food. None of the hipsters around me seemed to mind, with lines out the door, particularly after 3 a.m., when bars close. La Banquise tops the standard poutine dozens of ways, most pretty meaty. I chose Galvaude, with peas and shredded turkey, and was stuffed two-thirds of the way through.
The deals: Enjoy $3 draft beers, well drinks, and appetizers such as the popular hot wings, sliders and calamari.

The best parts of the film, for me, came toward the end, when the lives of the four lovers become bittersweet and melancholy. They were so happy for a time. They were inseparable. Now it is all over. There's a flashback where they walk together down to the farm pond to wash off the flour. As they dry contentedly in the sun, Teri still has a little flour behind her ear. You can't do better than that.

Aside from oddities like the action spoof “Red,’’ Hollywood tends to relegate actors in their 60s, no matter how accomplished, to supporting roles. So it’s a delight to see William Hurt and Isabella Rossellini given an age-appropriate showcase that doesn’t involve heavy artillery.

Which brings us back to Justice Ginsburg. She would have people believe that if the court rules the individual mandate unconstitutional, the conservative thing to do would be to preserve the rest of Obamacare.

Grohl is a wiseguy, but he was dead serious about his obligation to provide maximum entertainment at wall-shaking volume. His band — as tight and taut as a guitar string after months of touring behind their latest album, "Wasting Light" — played for nearly three hours, and he spent much of that time running around the stage like a spray-paint vandal chased by the cops.

Merkel and Sarkozy also said they did not want to increase the size of the EU's 440 billion euro rescue fund, which may have to take over a massive, multibillion euro European Central Bank program to support the prices of Spanish and Italian bonds by buying them up on the open market.

Lincoln gained his second major-league win by augmenting his fastball with a split-finger pitch against lefthanded bats and a slider against righties.

Despite its terribly artful and plush staging, "Finding Neverland" never managed to get around the quiet, solitary and anti-dramatic nature of writing. At least it spared us painful scenes of Johnny Depp as Barrie toiling over a manuscript, opting instead for sudden depictions of his fertile imagination, seen as if through his mind's eye. Yet, for all its intelligence, this movie in the end settles for being a high-end tear-jerker. Somehow, I was hoping for more revelation — and even, I admit, a rosebud or two. Instead, Barrie, in Depp's muted portrayal, remains as remote as he likely was in real life.

AMSTERDAM, May 3 (Reuters) - Dutch food and chemicals group
A small group of lawmakers have held "pro-forma" sessions every three days. These involve the quick use of a gavel to call a session to order -- and to immediately conclude it. Doing this seemingly fulfilled a constitutional requirement for avoiding a recess, which served singular purpose: to keep the president from going around the Senate during the winter break and making a recess appointment. Or so members thought.

When rain interrupts my tennis plans, I struggle to get through my cloud of disappointment. Finding a benefit isn't easy. But if I am willing to engage the question, something positive emerges. Usually I can find an equally good and enjoyable use of my time. I've worked hard to acquire this skill. When, for example, I've let a few extra pounds slip on, I am grateful for the gentle whisper telling me to get back on track. Without that internal mechanism, I might keep gaining.
Although the many individuals she includes are difficult to keep straight, each one's experience helps to flesh out the unfolding nightmare. Children are sure to relate to the many scenes of women and children being separated from husbands and fathers and to react even more viscerally to scenes reported from the water.

Messer countered last week by unveiling the Daniels endorsement. Messer also lent his campaign $50,000 in April, increasing his intake to $618,639.

"When we recorded the sides in this album . . . there was one unvarying reaction: Every time Aretha began a song, the musicians would shake their heads in wonder. After each take was completed, they would rush from the studio into the control room to hear the playback. Producers, engineers and musicians alike were entranced by Aretha's purity of tone, her tremendous feeling for inspired variation and her unparalleled dynamics."
Nigiri selections number 30, and the fish is fresh. Two well-made pieces run from $2.75 (for fried tofu, or inari) to $9.95 (for fatty tuna, or toro); most, though, run between $3 and $4. Rolls run to traditional California -- Rock 'n' Roll, Lion King -- with a few local improvisations, like the Oakland (eel and cream cheese) and the Golden Gate (salmon, tuna, crab and avocado). But there are also more Japanese-style choices, like the Shiso Ika (squid, shiso leaf, cucumber and plum paste). Busting the bargain limit but still worth trying is the chirashi, an artfully arranged bowl of sushi rice topped with a dozen kinds of fish ($13).

He and his compatriots jump the shark when they claim that employers can't deny their employees "safe and effective health-care." Of course they can: It's their business, their money and their insurance plans. Thousands of businesses don't provide insurance at all.
Earlier in the discussion, Hoehn tried to split the issue into two votes. He motioned to vote on just the ball fields for $1.9 million, then on the bus lot for $500,000. Hoehn suggested the bus lot could be moved to a different site. Superintendent Pam Sloan said she did not know if $500,000 would be enough to cover the move.
Early in the evening, as the bachelorette and birthday parties are beginning to assemble, Howl is relatively calm, if loud. People sing in their seats, applause is absent-minded, requests are scarce. This is where the drinking comes in: Howl specializes in various cocktail delivery methods, from scary-looking "Jell-O Injectors" to "Howlin' Buckets" of fruity mixed drinks.
My close friend has become the Patron Saint of Stressed Mothers over the last two years.

If they are "just friends," I cannot understand the total secrecy of this relationship (her husband was equally clueless). I am having a difficult time with this. It is as if they had conducted an intimate physical affair. The emotional distress has been devastating and it has devastated our marriage.
The invasive beetles could directly threaten endangered butterfly species in Oregon. The beetles have reached Mount Hebo, one of the few remaining habitats of the threatened Oregon silverspot butterfly. The beetle thrives in similar environments as does the endangered Fender's blue butterfly in the Willamette Valley. No one has documented the beetles eating silverspot or Fender's blue butterfly eggs, caterpillars or cocoons, but LaBonte says the beetles would have no trouble finding them. Gazelle beetles climb shrubs and grasses, unlike their more earth-bound relatives.

Native, drought-tolerant plants will help you save water, but that's not the only way you can conserve resources when you upgrade your patio and surrounding landscape. Invest in drip irrigation that targets just the plants needing water; permeable pavers that allow rain to filter through to the ground rather than running into the street; solar-powered or LED patio lights; and recycled materials for benches and the patio floor.

President Obama is fond of blaming his troubles on an obstructionist Congress, though he had massive majorities in both houses for two years — and the reason the House of Representatives now opposes him is simply because it was ordered to do so by the same voters he believes wanted him to go even further down the path he was heading.

Still, the report was not all negative. The government revised upward earlier estimates for payroll growth in February and March by a combined 53,000 jobs.
Top Picks Analysis: A.J. Smith normally isn't gun-shy about moving up in the first round and snaring a player he covets, but the embattled general manager benefited from holding his ground this year. In desperate need of a dangerous pass rusher to give the defense more bite, the Chargers had the good fortune of having one of this year's best in Ingram fall to them at the 18th overall choice. The squatty college lineman can quickly get to the edge with an explosive first step, plus he's stout enough to hold up against the run and displayed excellent lateral agility at the combine that will aid him in coverage. Another possible starter at a thin position was plucked with the second-round selection of Reyes, a powerful and hard-working prospect with the frame to work as a five-technique end in San Diego's 3-4 alignment. Smith's only trade of the draft came in the third round, when he vaulted five spots to claim Taylor, one of the steadying forces on a dominant LSU defense. He's a good tackler with some range and adequate speed, but his best asset may be in the leadership category.
"We felt it was very important for JobsOhio to have a long term revenue stream to give companies comfort that what is going on here in Ohio is long-term," said Kvamme, the group's president and interim chief investment officer. "So the 25-year lease was an integral part of this."

But there are older artists here, too. Red Krayola, the Texas rock band (founded in 1966, thank you very much) is performing, and one gallery is actually devoted to a dead artist, Forrest Bess, who died in 1977. Bess was a regular at the Betty Parsons gallery from 1949-67, but his day job was bait fishing off the Gulf coast of Texas; he’d met Parsons in ’48 and charmed her with his art, paintings, mostly, with some collage. Bess had some unusual ideas about sexuality that he thought his paintings illustrated, but Parsons would never let him explain those theories in wall texts. So the Biennial has given Los Angeles artist Robert Gober (he of the realistic clothed human leg sticking straight out of the wall) an entire room to finally give Bess his full due.

Egyptian sheets won't solve your insomnia. And we've found that no matter how much we spend on a duvet, we still have that crazy dream where we show up late for the press conference in lederhosen and Uggs.

I stood and recited the Pledge of Allegiance, as I have nearly every Monday night for the past 18 years, while Boy Scouts saluted the flag.
The nurse pushed play, and our intimate audience was transported to PubertyLand. Unlike the videos I suffered through in middle school, this production included actual actors, story lines and realistic scenes. Super supportive parents with soothing voices guided their confused children through baffling issues like oily skin and maxi pads. I sat back smugly. My daughter and I had this puberty thing in the bag.
But no matter the reception — not that anyone expects a bad one — the fact that the bar is built and will soon be open for business is reason enough for Wagner, her husband, and Bielski to celebrate.
Carpenter's appearance meant the end of Jake Westbrook's first start of the season. Westbrook became the second Cardinals starter to complete seven innings as he held the Reds to one run (it was unearned) off seven hits and four walks. All four of the walks came in the first two innings. After that Westbrook settled in, got some help from his defense, and zoomed ahead to 21 outs on a frugal 88 pitches.

Comedy of manners turns into full-blown farce at the hands of Yasmina Reza in "God of Carnage." That's a bit disappointing after savoring the French playwright's lighter and more piercing touch in plays like "Art" and "The Unexpected Man."

Erin Emmans owns Teasers Salon on Main Street and the Thrift Cellar downstairs. The salon is a destination stop for customers, but those customers have been arriving late for appointments since the work began. The Thrift Store relies on impulse shoppers.

Yes, council over the years has been frustrated by actions of the board. But they recognized the potential dangers inherent in an elected school board. Despite that frustration, and despite the fact that the county council had little influence on who is appointed to the board, they all felt the solution of an elected board would be worse. Most of my colleagues think an elected board would be acceptable — if that board had the responsibility of raising the revenue and defending tax rates to voters.

His rejuvenation has rubbed off on his bandmates. It wasn’t long ago that guitarist Nils Lofgren had both hips replaced; at the Izod Center, he took a long, wild, imaginative solo during "Because the Night" while gyrating and hopping in circles on one leg. Drummer Max Weinberg and bassist Garry Tallent gave the impression that they could play another two and a half hours without dropping a stitch.

Fueled By Ramen — the New York-based label that has dominated commercial power-pop — practically treats him as an in-house resource. He’s worked on many of the major Fueled By Ramen releases of the past few years, including Fall Out Boy’s “Infinity on High,” “Santi” by the Academy Is …, and Panic! at the Disco’s marvelously baroque “Vices and Virtues.” It is no exaggeration to suggest that radio sounds the way it now does in part because of him.

A: Thanks for the tutorial and, no, you're not the first to bring this to my attention -- and you're not the first to completely misinterpret the lyric and miss the metaphor. Believe me, I've consumed enough alcoholic beverages in my time to know how they are made and what the proper nomenclature is. But that line in the song has little or nothing to do with alcoholic beverages. It's a sociopolitical statement. My only regret would be having to explain it in detail to you, which would defeat the purpose of using literary devices in songwriting and lower the discussion to some silly and irrelevant argument about chemical processes.

Hey, Jason: My biggest knock on Shurmur is that he tried to go from Point A to Point D without touching Points B and C. By that I mean he gave Colt McCoy too much responsibility right off the bat. I think he should have leaned on the running game he inherited early to help the offensive line and McCoy settle into a rhythm together.

Ottway, thanks to his training as a hunter and the fact he's the lead guy in Carnahan's script, takes charge, trying to figure out how to get through the fierce, frozen forests - and how to avoid being eaten by a pack of seriously angry wolves.
Suppose we increased the federal gasoline tax by 25 cents a gallon, from 18.4 cents to 43.4 cents. That would raise $291 billion over the decade from 2012 to 2021, estimates the CBO. Or we could advance the ages for early and full Social Security benefits; one suggestion is to raise them (now 62 and 66) by two months a year until reaching predetermined targets (say, 64 and 70). The CBO reckons the decade's savings at about $264 billion. How about slowly moving Medicare's eligibility age from 65 to 67. The savings: $125 billion.

The governor's MIA, the Senate's overrun by boodlers and bunglers. The Assembly? Bought and paid for.
A SteriPen water purifier has long been a must-have on multi-day river trips and desert hikes, but my one complaint has been the batteries — if you're at all environmentally conscious, the idea of tossing out those four lithium AAs, even as long as they last, can be tougher to stomach than a glassful of protozoan cysts.
For starters, it was the first time that such a large group of heads of state ventured into that once taboo area. And there are several other non-related factors that may contribute to put decriminalization in the front burner later this year, or in early 2013.

And now she's adding South Jersey's stage to her resume with a starring turn in The Eagle Theatre's production of "Pippin," opening tonight.
So, if this can really be the end, the Is-Eli-Really-Elite Debate had a nice eight-year run. It started nearly from the moment he was drafted (Is He Worth Trading Up?) to his early seasons (Is He As Good As Philip Rivers?) and survived even through winning a Super Bowl. It was rekindled when, in a rare brazen moment, he lumped himself with Brady during an August radio interview.

"When we have the ball, we have to be dangerous on offense."
Blessing wrote this play in 1999, by which time the firestorm generated by the National Endowment for the Arts' grants to four controversial individual performance artists (Karen Finley and Holly Hughes among them), as well as the funding of tax-supported museums exhibiting Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually graphic photographs, had subsided just a bit. But you can still smell the ache as well as the giddy delight in every sentence he wrote. And these days, even as politicians aim at larger targets, "Chesapeake" has the feel of a fresh wake-up call. (And, it must be said, Spalding Gray aside, Blessing, who is best known for his play "Into the Woods," writes far more brilliantly than the lion's share of performance artists around.)

The meal ended the way it began, with a showstopping surprise a cup of rich warm chocolate with thick whipped cream, and a little shot of bitter German beer. Our waiter suggested that we alternate sips -- first chocolate and then beer.

* Through his first three starts, opponents are batting .080 against Kyle Lohse's fastball, and .091 against his slider. Lohse has used the fastball on 55 percent of his pitches. But the real key to his success has been Lohse's ability to command three pitches and throw them consistently for strikes. His in-zone rate for the fastball and changeup is 64 percent, and it's 61 percent for his slider.

Ayala is joined in the kitchen by the lovely Yesinia Camacho, who is as excited as Ayala about introducing their native cuisine to new audiences. Ayala’s cousin, William "Ito" Torres, is a roofer by day and a cook by night — he likes to get creative with the salads. Ayala’s father, Angelo, is visiting from Puerto Rico and helping out, and mom Maria arrives with Ayala’s 90-year-old grandmother, Otilia Espinosa, next week. They both fully expect to take over the kitchen for a week and show their boy how it’s done.
Fortunately for us, the Sherlock who resides at 221B Baker street today is both as fiendishly clever and in some ways even odder than his precursors, and yet more like us because he is so much a man of our times. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch can make Sherlock seem cold—shutting down potential clients with a loud "bor-ing!"—but he's just as demented as the rest of us when ransacking his apartment for a forbidden pack of cigarettes.

As a result, in 2010, only 2 percent of the autistic children getting intensive treatments at state expense were in managed-care plans. The majority, Dawson says, were "by and large middle class or upper-middle-class children."
I was wrong. From the start, "Shortbus" made me glad for the wait -- and of course, glad for the "command" to see it. Mistress Morgana and I agreed that it was the best portrayal and contextualization of hard-core sex -- real sex -- that we'd seen yet in a film. The movie opens with a medley of the main characters having explicit sex, from autofellatio to intercourse in many amazing positions. And in each case it's realistic to a fault, without telling the viewer what to think about the sex they're seeing. Fluids fly, women seek orgasm openly for its own sake and nothing else.
Weber State selected Jody Sears, 44, as its interim football coach to replace John L. Smith. Smith left Monday to take the Arkansas job following that school's firing of Bobby Petrino.
All six rounds fired were recovered by Fanwood police.
øSince not all student loans participate in IBR or loan forgiveness, you could certainly ask your lender about a graduated payment. Graduated payments result in a lower payment for a pre-determined amount of time, but the payments will eventually increase. This could make sense if you felt something will change in your financial situation. Make sure to ask the lender in advance what your payment will be when it increases, because it will be necessary to have the income to meet this payment further down the road.
Inge, an All-Star in 2009 when he had 84 RBIs, added a sacrifice fly in the seventh for his first game with at least four RBIs since July 5, 2010, against Minnesota. The third baseman was 1-for-10 with four strikeouts in the two previous games.

"It's going to cause the investment menu to narrow," Carroll said, as quoted by Bloomberg news. "We won't have 6,000 mutual funds in our network probably two years from now like we do today."
The rebuke of Ryan is a credit to the Catholic leaders, because they are displaying their doctrinal consistency even as politicians embrace church teachings selectively. Republicans hailed the Catholic bishops when they were opposing the Obama administration's policy to expand contraceptive coverage; likewise, they cite the church's opposition to abortion. But these same lawmakers have little interest in the church's position against the death penalty or its opposition to the Arizona immigration law.

SALEM — Woodstown native Cpl. Derek A. Kerns was one of two U.S. Marines killed this week during a military training exercise in Morocco, military officials said Friday.
Attorneys in Cuyahoga County are not assigned as counsel until after indictment and county arraignment. Now that may be quite convenient for the attorney (especially those who benefit at taxpayers' expense from an assignment system to a tune reaching six figures annually), but it's hell on the client sitting in the county jail. And it often means indictments issued that were entirely avoidable.

1. Left tackle. David Diehl is the incumbent, but he won’t line up there to start the preseason. With guards Rich Seubert and Chris Snee out with injuries, Diehl will slide inside while William Beatty begins the game at left tackle.

Yet some hospitals do make it easier. On its website, Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena allows people to select several common procedures and get an instant price quote, including an estimate of the patient's share after plugging in their deductible and coinsurance. But even those numbers exclude the thousands of dollars that physicians, anesthesiologists and other specialists would tack on for most surgeries.
In the other direction the fire was creeping toward Chinatown, at once the plague spot and the wonderland of San Francisco. When the flames reached this district, it ignited like kindling wood. It covered over seven or eight blocks, but ten thousand people were packed in it. It was said to be fairly honey-combed with human habitations underneath. Of all the suffering from the fire, I think the despised Chinese faired the worse, for they were the poorest and no American homes were open to them. It was from Chinatown that most of the dead bodies were taken, and no doubt untold numbers are still lying under the debris. Probably, many of them were opium fiends, who were too stupified to make their escape from these underground death-traps.

Nicholas Stoller directs and re-teams with Jason Segel on the script -- the pair worked together on the superior "Forgetting Sarah Marshall." In another Judd Apatow production, they try to mine a similar vein -- call it the profane romantic comedy. But here, the story drags on too long, and it's not as inspired to begin with. Segel stars as Tom, half of the couple who can't seal the deal, and Emily Blunt plays Violet, his fiancée. Segel is a warm-and-fuzzy presence in everything he's in, and Blunt is delightful. Some bits are funny, some vulgar, some sweet.
Then, a few days later, juror Luis Alba expressed his unhappiness with his own decision to convict. In a July 9 Star-Ledger article, the 48-year-old private security guard from Hudson County, said: "It’s unfortunate, but I don’t think he (Elwell) accepted the money as a bribe." He also said, "Personally, I hope the defense appeals, and if they get a technicality, they can get him free of the (bribery) charge."

* When Hitchcock took over on Nov. 8, he installed a system that featured short shifts to avoid having players out on the ice too long, dragging and vulnerable. The fresher the legs the faster the tempo, and with Hitch as coach the Blues had more shifts per game than any NHL team. The same is true in the NHL postseason. The Blues have taken 1,898 shifts through four games, most among the 16 postseason teams. That's an average 474.5 shifts per game, the most by any of the 16 postseason teams. San Jose is averaging 435.8 shifts per game. On at least one occasion the Blues caught the Sharks in a long, tiring shift and it played a role in B.J. Crombeen's goal that gave the Blues a 1-0 lead in Game 4.
As for the suggestion that BackBid could turn the hotel industry hypercompetitive, I have only one thing to say to that: Now hotels know how it must have felt when Priceline burst onto the scene and consumers had to guess the winning rate when they made a "name your own price" bid.

Like the beautiful October afternoon in 1989, when the San Francisco Giants were playing the Oakland Athletics in the World Series. And then, out of nowhere, came an earthquake. It caused the Cypress Structure of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to pancake and caused a big fire in San Francisco's Marina district. Brick buildings collapsed in San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Watsonville. The earthquake lasted only 15 seconds, but it killed 63 people and put the fear of God into millions.

The re-signing of Kiwanuka figured to be bad news for Osi Umenyiora in his quest for a new contract.

While the power the Cardinals have shown so far this season gets the headlines - they had their second three-homer inning in four days Monday - the depth of the team has been on display as well. Much of that comes from Molina holding down the No. 6 spot. Molina hit .316 from that spot last season, and had 22 RBIs in 46 starts there. On Monday, his two-run double from the sixth spot in the eighth inning was his first hit with runners in scoring position this season.

But his impact on the court was non-existent. From a wins and losses standpoint, it doesn't matter if he returns. If he's on the roster there needs to be at least one -- if not two -- better centers in front of him. Otherwise, you're playing 4-on-5 on offense and 4.5-on-5 on defense too often.

After pretty much embedding themselves with engine companies, what they found was a group of dedicated public servants -- with the hearts of heroes and the resources of a financially strapped city -- waging a continuous battle and facing a huge arson problem. Helmet cams provided a rare look at what firefighters actually see inside burning structures, while Putnam and Sanchez's interviews delved into how they feel about their difficult job. "Burn" has earned the support of "Rescue Me" star Denis Leary, a firefighter advocate who's come on board as an executive producer.

In her late 80s, Tanning found a new outlet in poetry. She jokingly referred to herself as "the oldest living emerging poet."
This notion of nothingness as a fundamental condition creates a vivid tension in the book, where entropy and forgetfulness are always lapping at the edges of the stories. Nowhere is this more prevalent than in the title piece, at 85 pages more novella than short story, which revolves around Alma, an older woman in the middle stages of dementia who is an outpatient in an experimental memory clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. Set slightly in the future, in a time when memories can be recorded on small digital cartridges and played back in all their sensory lushness, the story addresses both individual and collective history, since Alma's late husband, Harold, was an amateur paleontologist. Her recollection of him "reclaiming something vital, … grappling with his own infinitesimal place in time," pushes against both her own gradual disintegration and the hard, sharp fact of Harold's death to remind us how ephemeral our grip on identity really is. "Dr. Amnesty's cartridges," Doerr writes, "the South African Museum, Harold's fossils, Chefe Carpenter's collection, Alma's memory wall — weren't they all ways of trying to defy erasure? What is memory anyway? How can it be such a frail, perishable thing?" The point is that, whether on the grand scale or the personal, it is not enough to build a firewall against the void.

To prepare for Illinois' probable plunge into insolvency, read "Freedom to Fail: The Keystone of American Federalism" by Paul E. Peterson and Daniel Nadler in the University of Chicago Law Review. They note that only 25 of the world's 193 nations have federal systems, and in most of the 25 the freedom of the lower tiers of government is more circumscribed by the central government than American state governments are by the federal government. American states' greater freedom - autonomy under America's system of dual sovereignty - from the central government's supervision requires that they be disciplined instead by the market for government bonds, and the real possibility of default.

Yes, Amanda out of the picture works out for Emily’s ultimate revenge plot, but it also leaves Jack able to continue to pine.

I am a bit weary of paying for P.G.& E's mistakes and blunders, not to mention their oversights and their derelict sense of responsibilities. Like the heinous gas line explosion of Sept. 9, 2010 in San Bruno. So I repeat, "Who Are These Guys"?

-- Give manager Bob Melvin bonus points for naming Yoenis Céspedes the A's center fielder early in spring training, over the strong objections of Coco Crisp. It was a vote of confidence in the new guy, a sign to him that the team believes he belongs.

We have also had to adapt to working with less staff and fewer resources. Yet politicians would point the finger of blame at us and our unions with one hand while handing out tax breaks to big businesses with the other. We refuse to be the governor's scapegoats and allow him to take the focus away from what really matters to the people of Ohio: creating jobs, allowing us to make a livable wage to take care of our families, and being treated with dignity and respect.

The survey results confirm what area players have known since the place went public in 1963: Sleepy ranks as one of the best challenges in the area. It is demanding but fair. You will find plenty of trouble if you are not accurate, from the many deep ravines to the 58 bunkers that strategically dot the course.

The course is a classic "out and in" design, with the opening holes on both nines playing downhill and with the wind and the incoming holes playing uphill and into the wind. The fairways are narrow and the Cleveland Metroparks woods lurk as stealers of errant shots.

Air samplings along the south edge of the property, which is lined by houses, showed methane concentrations of 30 to 40 percent a couple of years ago, Schwarz said. Methane's explosive range is between 5 and 15 percent concentration; heavier than that and there isn't enough oxygen to sustain a fire, but the higher readings were still troubling.

So, Girardi loaded up his lineup with right-handers, meaning the odd alignment of Chris Stewart behind the plate so Russell Martin's bat could stay in the lineup at designated hitter.

Easy on the ears. Power tools are noisy, and too much blasting from a loud motor isn't healthy at any age. Give some high-quality headphones that will block noise and protect hearing in loud workshops and when power tools are in use.

And look for built-in sound control in the tools you select. Example: The engine, fan housing and exhaust tube on Husqvarna's 356B T backpack blower for large yards is insulated to dampen noise, which is good for the operator and for the neighbors.

You apparently learned your social skills from a park ranger. Playing dead is a successful strategy when you’re being chased by certain types of bears. When you’re hoping to be chased by a man, you need to go over and say hello. But, you whimper, you’re scared. Yeah, OK. But, why would that be reason to avoid doing it? By making yourself do something you’re afraid of, you shrink your fears and probably feel better afterward, unless it’s something like walking off the ledge of a tall building.
The chicken salad sub ($7.75) features smooth, creamy chicken salad made from all-white meat. The hot sausage sub ($6.70), while tasty enough, is nowhere near hot. The meatball sub ($6.70) is Italian grandma-worthy, although you may wish for more sauce (which I promptly added at home).

There are a host of reasons for these cost controls. Large banks face declining revenue from a federal law reducing swipe fees that are charged each time you use a bank debit card. Banks and credit unions also are earning very little on the investments they make with your money. And loan demand, the traditional way banks make money, is down. The interest they can charge on loans is low.

The number of people who are prevented from committing suicide off the bridge is hard to pin down. The bridge district says 51 to 54 for each of the past four years. But those are only the people it knows about. Officers who patrol the bridge stop and talk to anyone who looks even remotely forlorn or out of place. Bridge officials won't discuss how many people are involved or give details about patrolling. Suicide prevention comes under the greater concept of bridge security, which became sensitive information after Sept. 11, 2001.

This is why I believe the first step following the 2003 invasion of Iraq should have been the privatization of the oil fields. If the government had given every individual over 21 equal shares in a corporation that had the right and responsibility to make appropriate arrangements with foreign oil companies for the purpose of discovering and developing Iraq's oil reserves, the oil income would have flowed in the form of dividends to the people - the shareholders - rather than into government coffers.

But I know if I just stay true to the experience, and to what I see as real, it's not gonna leave 'em in a dark place -- it just exposes a dark place.

City officials and the visitor's bureau have been trying for decades to create an entertainment area to bring tax dollars and a sense of identity to the city. The closest they came was in the 1990s when a developer planned a Universal Studios-type project next to Great America, though it never came to fruition.

The scene spoke of a tranquil lifestyle. But it didn't mean I had forgotten to stay alert.

You want to get up from these pages feeling groggy, as if you've been wrenched out of everyday experience, drawn into a landscape where the boundary between reality and imagination has been rendered moot.

"I, of course, believed in taxes, having gone to a state school. I used to contend that I believed in voluntary taxes.

Hes a guy that you could get together with and talk ball. Nowadays you know, there used to be a lot of coaches groups. There arent as many anymore. And when you do, they talk shoe contracts, radio show revenue, who knows, a million different issues. Izzo is a throwback, and I think part of that is Heathcote. I think part of thats not having been a good player. Part of that is the Upper Peninsula, and part of it is his own personality and integrity. Ill tell you when I worked (at) ESPN, and I went to the practices, his was the second-best.
Financier Warren Buffet has energized liberals with his still-unverified claim that his tax rate lags his secretary's. If true, "fairness" could mean slashing his secretary's taxes to match Buffet's 11 percent effective tax rate. Somehow, reducing the secretary's taxes never came up. Instead liberals and Democrats demand the so-called Buffet Rule, an instrument for bludgeoning the successful rather than boosting the downtrodden.

The biggest issue, not surprisingly, will be Afghanistan, where Obama has more than doubled the number of U.S. troops but also set a target date of July 2011 to begin a gradual drawdown. Republican hawks such as Sen. John McCain, of Arizona, praised the escalation but criticized the exit date; Democratic doves such as Sen. Russell D. Feingold, of Wisconsin, who lost his bid for re-election last week, weren't happy about the surge but took comfort in the calendar.

Groups representing teachers, principals and superintendents say they're concerned about a proposal that could double the number of standardized tests issued in public schools, including 10 more exams at the high school level in such courses as chemistry and physics.

If you're intent on speedy dining, it's best to call ahead for takeout (even if you eat there) because it's not until you make a request that the thwack-thwack-thwack of dough being patted out for your safeeha is heard. If you order empanada-like baked fatayer (stuffed with spinach, pine nuts and onion or with cheeses) or meat-stuffed baked samosas, they won't go into that oven until you order them.

The important words are “decades old.” The conventional wisdom is that the much-reviled Citizens United decision opened the way for sugar daddies Foster Friess and Sheldon Adelson to spend megabucks furthering the candidacies of Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, respectively. They do this through hefty donations to "super PACs," taking advantage of a federal appeals court decision that followed and cited Citizens United. Their largesse has inspired a generic lament about the outsize role wealthy individuals can play in elections.

The collective sigh that signaled all the fun in the world was dead echoed through the car until Big Bits, our 6-year-old, grabbed some paper from his backpack and sent it into the air. It flew about too, not quite as crazily as the bag but it was still fun. Someone in Big Bit's kindergarten class had recently taught him about paper airplanes, which of course he loved (what kid doesn't?), but he still wasn't 100 percent sure about how to fold paper into an airplane shape. That didn't stop him from randomly folding paper and seeing if it flew any better. This met with varying degrees of success. Little Bits, who will enthusiastically tell you he's 4 if you give him half a second, did his big brother one better and just wadded up the paper into a ball. This didn't work at all.

That could mean gambling on more costly projects. The water authority recently decided to spend about $400,000 analyzing a concept that was last assessed a decade ago: delivering water from Imperial irrigators to San Vicente Reservoir near Lakeside.

Advocates state that the gas tax is needed because our aging transportation system is crumbling. To be sure, congestion has grown, but are our roads crumbling as a result?

Just 87 percent of season ticket holders renewed, and after the Colts invited wait-list customers to purchase tickets, they were left with 4,000 to sell to the public.
Davidson said organizers decided to change to a better-quality paper for the tickets, which also contributed to the delay.

When shopping for sesame oil (sometimes labeled "toasted sesame oil" and often hidden in the Asian or International aisle), the darker the color, the richer the flavor. And while loads of antioxidants give sesame oil a long shelf life, refrigerating it will make it last even longer.
They have reacted, however, in what I can only assume are hostile ways. One night, we found a giant bullfrog (dead) in my office. Wilbur subsequently waddled in with a mole in his mouth (also dead). Previously, we had only been given mice as presents. Now they seem to be moving on to bigger things. We hope these are not subtle messages.
The violence also threatened one of Bahrain's key international marketing pushes. Formula 1 organizers said they may pull next month's race in Bahrain, the opening event in the racing circuit's season. Already, the GP2 Asia Series—a race similar to the main GP2 series that serves as a feeder to Formula 1—canceled its second round of races scheduled for this week at the Bahrain International Circuit due to the events there, according to the GP2 website. The site said the Bahrain Motorsport Federation requested the cancellation.
"Traditional luxury hotels have frequently had this ability. For customers who haven't asked or didn't know that these kinds of facilities are available to them, we can say, 'Look what we can do.' And it's not reinventing the wheel, because 80% of this was something we already did."
But even with seven panels working regular business hours, they would need a year to clear that pile, County Executive Ed FitzGerald said.

Among the candidate's larger stands is his support for changes in the law that would make it easier for a single party to have an absolute majority in the lower house of Mexico's Congress, raising the prospect of a country where the PRI, which already governs most states, could hold the levers of powers in all levels of government - as it did for most of the last century.

Those amended tax returns are filed on paper and processed manually. They go into a pool with other amended returns. The IRS receives 5 million to 7 million such returns each year, a spokesman said. Some buyers who asked for the credit in the spring are just hearing back from the IRS.

Midwest Generation also gets an extra year to decide what to do with its Waukegan coal plant, 40 miles north of Chicago on Lake Michigan. In documents filed Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, its parent company said it is "less likely to install environmental controls" at Waukegan, meaning the plant could shut down by 2014. The company said it also might shut down one of the units at its Joliet coal plant and "possibly others" at plants in Romeoville and downstate Pekin.
Because of his years of broad legal experience, both inside and outside the courtroom, I believe Mike would make an excellent circuit court judge. Moreover, Mike's practical, grounded approach, would enhance the quality and efficiency of our circuit court.

I’ll let Contra Costa coach Alonzo Carter state my case for Goins seeing time this fall: “You don’t recruit a JUCO guy to redshirt. You recruit a JUCO guy to play.” In Goins – no relation to Kenneth – the Terps landed a cornerback with solid size and speed coming off one of the best junior college seasons of any defensive back in California. Goins, who chose the Terps over Idaho, New Mexico State and San Jose State, should provide depth for a Maryland secondary that lost cornerbacks Cameron Chism and Trenton Hughes to graduation.

I'm not looking for answers from the irrational windbags who lead with raw knee-jerk emotions, or the snide citizens who look down at pro sports as if they were eying cancerous growths rather than valued civic commodities.
Edison officials were also upset.
The division races for the first ever Pac-12 Championship Game could be closer to completion after this weekend. An ASU victory over UCLA would mean the Sun Devils would have to lose three of their final four games to not win the division. If Oregon (at Washington) and Stanford (at Oregon State) win this weekend as expected, Stanford can win the North Division by beating the Ducks at home on Nov. 12.
Apparently, the intersection of Altair Drive and Pitman-Downer Road (a Gloucester County road) has not experienced enough major accidents to have caused the county to make some changes.

Last holiday season, she began contemplating the Thanksgiving pecan pie. How crazy would it be to make an olive oil pecan pie with an olive oil crust? Not crazy at all, it turns out.

Overall, the food quality at lunch might have been more consistent, but the workday atmosphere was more sedate. I overheard conversations about investing in oil pipelines, surgeries gone bad, and co-workers from hell.

For better or worse, the Internet makes music instantly available to anyone who wants to hear it. Many of the sources aren't legal, but they're free and easy to find. As a result, broadband has effectively ended the era when people had to buy an album to find out how good every track was (or wasn't). Consumers expect to be able to hear a recording before committing it to their collection. The challenge for artists and labels is to persuade potential fans to do so on legitimate, royalty-paying sites. At the same time, they have to find ways to introduce themselves to new generations of listeners. That means having a presence on the sites that millions of those listeners use, rather than trying to coax them to places chosen by the artist.

Debt: Defended 2008 bailout of financial institutions as a necessary step to avoid the system's collapse, opposed the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler and said any such aid should not single out specific companies.

There is no clutter in a dream state, either, and at a restaurant, that means no open shelves with plastic bottles of supplies like we saw at Tuli, no box of plastic wrap left on the counter or coffee cups stacked haphazardly atop the espresso machine to make me think about the messes in the real world we are paying to forget.

Dickens' works are great enough to survive most ill-considered decisions about their adaptation, and so it is with this, an attempt to offer a naturalistic version of the story. In treatments of works by other writers, that approach can enhance credibility, but it's too confining when applied to Dickens. Symbolism, comedy, exaggeration and melodrama all play significant roles in Dickens' greatest novels. Little is to be gained by flattening things out.

Yep, the proprietor said, it was indeed that same McCluer. He was an expatriated St. Louisan who had decided to take his custard-creating skills to Florida and make a living by fattening tourists.

Wet macular degeneration progresses more rapidly than the dry kind. It's a more dangerous threat to vision loss. Only five years ago, a new drug, strictly for wet degeneration, appeared. It's Lucentis, and it's given by injection into the eye. It's not guaranteed to improve vision, but it reliably stops the progression of wet degeneration. Avastin is a more recent drug, also given by eye injection, which works much like Lucentis. It is much less expensive. A third drug, marketed this past year, is Eylea, and it, too, is an eye-injected medicine.

This car might be your worst nightmare. A plug-in hybrid electric luxury sedan that costs more than $100,000, from a California company—Orange County, but still—which has borrowed $169 million from taxpayers as part of the Department of Energy's advanced-vehicle-technology loan program; a car built not in the heartland but the socialist paradise of Finland; a car that, with the arithmetic all in, averages 52 mpg-e (that's the EPA's metric for plug-in hybrid EVs), which means that for all its fancy-dancy lithium-iron-phosphate star drive, it gets about the same fuel economy as a conventional Prius hybrid.

From Billboard: Blunderbuss' has elements of nearly every project he's worked on  even some of the 1950s bounce of the White-produced Wanda Jackson album on I'm Shakin' ' and Trash Tongue'  but also shows sides that the self-imposed, regimented simplicity of the White Stripes didn't allow. There are softer piano-driven songs (Love Interruption') and, at the opposite extreme, filthy guitar raunch (16 Saltines'), but also elaborate tracks reminiscent of late-'60s psychedelia, like the Zombies or Small Faces. Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy' in particular is unlike anything White's ever done, with a complex, hop-scotching melody and rhythm; similarly, I Guess I Should Go to Sleep' has a soaring vocal, a jazzy tempo and a violin solo. With a sound that's vintage and organic but also very clean, the album is so diverse that virtually every song comes as a surprise.

The French believe they have a right to pleasure and are highly tolerant of their fellow citizens' private behavior. They don't seem to mind that President Nicolas Sarkozy and his stunning pop star wife, Carla Bruni, have had affairs and they weren't too distressed when the culture minister wrote openly of patronizing young male prostitutes abroad. While Americans have "proved time and again that they see a politician's cheating in marriage as tantamount to cheating on the voters and the country," the French "do not enjoy ugly revelations that disturb the surface and threaten the social fabric," Sciolino writes. In fact, male politicians are expected to exude virility as proof that they are able to handle the job. President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky was praised by even right-wing French politicians as a sign that he was a healthy male.

Then I open up the ironing board, I make sure it's functional, I look to see that there's no water in the iron and I put it in a corner of my room so it's ready to use. And then I unpack. ... I have a plastic liner from the drycleaners and I put that in the drawer first."

It’s also important to be thinking like a designer instead of a player. A lot of the stuff we get is just people basically campaigning to have their player be more powerful. They don’t think about the long-term about how that’s bad for the game. All of the things they want to work on are for their selfish desires as a player. You also have to be a huge consumer of games. Anyone we’ve interview, we ask them what games are you playing now, what are your favorite games of all time and why? What flaws have you found in them?

Do basketball fans in central Florida flock to the Amway Center merely because Howard is playing? Does anyone truly believe Howard possesses the game and intangibles needed to lead the Magic to an NBA championship? Is Howard really the one player the franchise can't afford to lose?

Take his chapter on chicken soup. There, Stone tells us, cooking the soup releases an amino acid that resembles the drug acetylcysteine, which is used to treat bronchitis and other respiratory ailments. The vitamins and nutrients in chicken soup slow the growth of mucus-stimulating white blood cells called neutrophils. And new Japanese research shows that the old-fashioned remedy may fight high blood pressure, too.

Another day I try the CE Brandt Farms Burger ($16.50), which is nice, but overpriced. A patty is topped with a braised short rib ragu and cheddar.

Methods vary. I tried more than a dozen recipes searching for the method I liked best. Several were more complicated than what I've described  managing all the individual components, at times hovering over the stove with a thermometer in one hand and a timer in the other, etc.  and it finally dawned on me (after I'd set my alarm so I could wake up on time to check on a batch of cheese incubating in the oven) that perhaps things need not be this complicated.

3. Great players have a short shelf life. A great coach like Rick Pitino is different. For all the storms about Pitino's flexible sense of loyalty, he has taken three teams to the Final Four (Providence, Kentucky, Louisville) with one title, at Kentucky in 1996. He was the first apostle of the 3-point shot. His Kentucky teams restored pressing defense to a prominence the tactic had not enjoyed since John Wooden's zone press at UCLA. Fashion-challenged with denim uniforms at Kentucky and those retina-searing day-glo orange things at Louisville, he still deserves to be in the Basketball Hall of Fame. Dick Vitale is in the HOF, admittedly as a broadcaster. So how high can the bar be?
(Some would say this proves that a coach needs to pick one guy and stay with him but I'm not convinced. It's not as if Smith and Resch were soiling the bed in the postseason in the years that they shared time.)

Pools on the road to Hana: As you can see from this list, I prefer the lush, rainy, green parts of Hawaii. The twisting, slow road to Hana on the eastern end of Maui passes by several pools fed by waterfalls. It’s an idyllic swimming hole for the adventurous able to withstand the cold. The pools come with their own dangers – slippery rocks (my wrist once took a whacking), waterborne illness and sudden flash floods that can turn a gentle waterfall into a thundering torrent. At least look, even if you don’t touch.

At least three bills, one executive order and one agency rule accomplish the same goals set out by ALEC using the same specific policies. In eight passages contained in those documents, New Jersey initiatives and ALEC proposals line up almost word for word. Two other Republican bills not pushed by the governor’s office are nearly identical to ALEC models.

The two dozen protesters at the state’s World War II Memorial have grievances for Trenton Mayor Tony Mack and President Obama — and lots of people in between. Some are upset about cuts to the Trenton police force. Others feel state budget cuts have harmed education. And they share the anger expressed at other camps over government bailouts on Wall Street.
The Whitecaps (4-2-2) had few chances from the run of play, but took advantage of a restart on the lone goal. Young-Pyo lofted the shot from 24 yards over goalkeeper Andy Gruenebaum's outstretched hands and into the upper-left corner — a play that both sides agreed was supposed to be a crossing pass.

Although employers in the state now are creating more jobs than they are cutting, it could take years for workers to recover fully. Arizona lost about one-tenth of its jobs during the recession, many of them construction and other blue-collar jobs.
Maybe it's North Carolina defensive end Quinton Coples. Or defensive tackles Fletcher Cox of Mississippi State or Michael Brockers of LSU. Offensive tackles Riley Reiff of Iowa and Jonathan Martin of Stanford, outside linebackers Melvin Ingram of South Carolina and Courtney Ingram of Alabama, or cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick of Alabama also are possibilities.

But in terms of Mario Manningham, who hauled in four passes for 68 yards and a touchdown last week, he knows exactly what to expect.

In 2006, it received an accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, making possible the recent arrival of a pair of Gibbons apes as part of the "species survivor" program.
It's little wonder that L.A. voters and ratepayers, most of whom can only dream of getting the gold-plated retirement packages and high salaries that are awarded to DWP workers, resent the City Council's frequent votes to raise utility rates. They were hit again Wednesday when the council approved a 2.9% hike for water rates, and even steeper annual increases are planned for the next three years. Yet for all the justified populist outrage, there's still a genuine need to raise DWP rates. DWP salaries are built into the utility's operating expenses, but the current rate hikes are needed to pay rising capital costs connected with higher prices for water and electricity, meeting federal and state standards for drinking water and switching to renewable power. Failure to approve the rate increases could result in fines costing ratepayers more than the increases.
"I'm a guy who needs filters. Lots of them," he tweeted after his comments were widely reported.
For example, last night's show started at 8:30 p.m. — only so that the network could get in its own half-hour of red-carpet interviews. But by 8:30, there have been literally hours of mind-numbing "Who are you wearing?" all over the rest of cable. The only reason for this was to give the network time for some extra, prime-time commercials.

Because without them, this season would've likely gotten off to a much dicier start.
ABOUT THE CAPITALS: While media and fans scrutinize Hunter's personnel decisions, the players say they support their coach all the way. "To be honest, it's not even something that we notice," said Capitals defenseman Karl Alzner. "We don't go down the sheet at the end of the game and say, 'How much did 'Ovi' play?' You know he wants to play more, and he's frustrated by not playing 20 minutes. But he doesn't care - he wants to win that game." Part of the reason for the diminished ice time is the play of Washington's third and fourth lines, which have performed well in the postseason.
Many alleged incidents also suggest that often, denying basic care not only causes prolonged pain and suffering but makes it far more expensive once doctors treat the patients.

Suppan's effort fell considerably short of being a gem. Twice he worked his way out of bases-loaded jams. And after five innings and 74 pitches, he was done - needing help from relievers Ernesto Frieri, Luke Gregerson and Dale Thayer to complete the Padres' first back-to-back shutout wins since July 2-3, 2010.
Nitrate expert Leslie Lewis is NFPF's Sherlock Holmes. She was the lead sleuth last year and also went through the material this time around with the help of the staff at the New Zealand archive.

Ford said it plans to update its sales forecast Wednesday, which currently calls for 13.3 million to 14.3 million light-vehicle sales.

What had I wanted from my trip to China? To engage in one of the oldest continuous cultures on our Earth? To sense what modern China might offer? I'd been shocked by the number of old women who begged for money. I'd felt sad seeing the charmless cities where architecture's old bones had been sacrificed for graceless apartments and impressive monuments. But I'd also been amazed at the warmth of China's people.

"For the amount of money that was spent, it should have been well-thought," said Olivia Stanley, parent of a second-grader. "They need to give them some activities up there — maybe a track, sports (equipment) or gymnastics space. They need to have something, rather than a place to just run up or down, or read books."

Conservatives can complain about transportation funds used to help balance the general fund budget over the years, but the scale of Maryland's needs far transcends those withdrawals. The Maryland Department of Transportation recently estimated the state's unfunded "top-priority" projects total more than $12 billion.
The state also has something to prove, given its spotty record of successful interventions in local governance. Snyder and the financial advisory board need to show Detroiters -- most of whom just want the lights on, the cops to come and the buses to run on time -- that the state really does intend to improve the city. Will that have to mean new money for the city along with restructuring? Maybe. But the answer is less critical than whether whatever the state does actually works.
Even users of the word look down their noses at some bespoke brethren. Stefan Paszke, one of the owners of Bespoke Cycles in San Francisco, says some companies tweak an off-the-shelf bicycle frame and unfairly call it custom. "That's not really a bespoke bike," he says. His shop takes dozens of measurements of a rider and completes a questionnaire about what kind of riding a customer does to create a handmade bike from $3,500 to the "sky is the limit," Mr. Paszke says.
Nick Peyton, maitre d' at Cyrus in Healdsburg, has served plenty of bling for dessert on Valentine's Day. He usually hides the ring under a silver dome and, with great flourish, removes the cover at just the right moment. Unfortunately, he says, everyone is too nervous to enjoy the meal.

New Jersey Appleseed Executive Director Renee Steinhagen, a lawyer who is a member of the NJ for Health Care coalition, said the federal government already requires hospitals to provide care to those without insurance.
The Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington are a region of a key swing state that will be critical for Romney. Obama won Virginia in 2008 after back-to-back Republican victories by George W.

Fischbeck went to Plan C. He renovated the existing house and he relandscaped, putting in terracing, walkways and patios. He has a tenant but is searching for a buyer.

He almost did it again. After a gut-wrenching trade to Detroit in 1960, Colavito returned to old Municipal Stadium with the Tigers on July 5, 1962 and hit three straight homers, missing a fourth with a monstrous drive into the upper deck that landed about 15 feet foul.
The $3.5 trillion spending plan the House budget chairman released Tuesday morning is a great deal like what Mr. Ryan and his tea-party-endorsed colleagues in the House offered last year — with a bit less detail in areas that got him and his party in so much trouble last year, like cuts in Medicare benefits for senior citizens.
But hockey fights happen for a reason and shouldn't be banned. For nearly 100 years, hockey has "policed" itself. If fighting were banned, there actually would be more thuggery on the ice, more rough tactics to try to instigate fights.
When I tell her this, I am met with anger. I've tried inviting her to my house, but she doesn't like it because it's too small. She also gets upset when I have plans with friends, arguing that I can see them any time. Am I the bad guy here? -- Feeling Guilty
It was as if Missourians' DNA lacked an entrepreneurial gene. St. Louis, in particular, had a big-company culture that seemed to steer ambitious young people into Fortune 500 firms, not risky startups.
On a recent afternoon at Tecate's Asao Restaurante, sunlight glinted on the goblets of excellent vintages from nearby Adobe Guadalupe winery. Lunch was an indulgence of contemporary Mexican cuisine, combining local ingredients and classic Mexican flavors with international influences and avant-garde techniques. On my plate, slices of house-cured tuna carpaccio, festively garnished with a confetti mix of diced jicama, pineapple and red onion, were topped with an avocado sorbet that delighted my taste buds with its smooth iciness. Other plates on the elegant table held comparable culinary treasures: succulent fruit and nut-crusted jumbo shrimp with hibiscus flower molé, rich duck confit in sweet-sour tamarind sauce, and juicy-rare chunks of rib-eye paired with a silky smooth coffee cream sauce. The superb food and the excellence of service rivaled that of any of Southern California's four-star eateries - but at a three-star price.

So if the PG&E request for customer payments gets PUC approval, Californians can expect all the big gas companies to pull in 11.35 cents of profit for every dollar they spend on repairs. The formula doesn't care whether those dollars come from customers or not. Because the customer dollars would be routed through the companies, it would all go on the books as a corporate expense.

Pages 131-133: Charlie Boynton walked ahead of his mother, taking a gravel path leading around the water tower, looking for a viewpoint. He saw a man sitting next to the water tower, with his back to him. The man was on his knees. Boynton couldn't see what he was doing. He walked quietly down the path as not to bother the man. Just as he got to the other side of the tower, the man said, "Hey you," or something to that effect. Boynton replied: "Hmmm, what?" "And he gets up and he looks all disheveled and I don't know, just tired and all shaking and he walked up to me and as he walked down to me, he was walking slowly... I could see red on his hand... red all smeared on his shirt." When the man was about 10 feet from Boynton, he said: "I am going to kill you." Boynton said the man looked right in his eyes as he said it. "And I said, 'Why would you kill me? I haven't done anything to you.' And he looked kind of angry and confused. I didn't know what to think so I was kind of inching away. I said: 'Sorry. I haven't done anything to you.' "

A: Doug Manchester and I met in 1981 in the early days of my YPO career, and I was drawn immediately to his energy, vision and significant willpower. In the mid-1990s we did some preliminary work together on a real estate development in Vietnam, but the Asian financial crisis killed that project. When I converted to Catholicism 15 years ago, I asked "Papa Doug" to be my godfather, and a few years ago, we traveled to Vatican City and he arranged for us to meet Pope Benedict XVI.

The most obvious design element of The Bent Brick will be the waiting area, which has a floor-to-ceiling installation made from unfinished 4-by-6 wood blocks surrounded by an irregularly shaped banquette. The wood block idea was inspired by my 7-year-old son, Mack, who was stacking wood in the backyard and doing it wrong. It looked sort of like what you would end up with if you were playing a game of Jenga, kind of airy, more sculptural than structural. And it occurred to me that would be a good idea for the new place. So I took a few photos and showed them to Mark, with the original thought of using actual pieces of firewood. That had a feel that was a little too lodge-y and rustic, so we switched it over to the rough lumber pieces for a more modern feel.
Spisak admitted to the killings in an interview with the Parole Board on Jan. 4, but he said he was mentally ill at the time.
"In a perfect world, a year seems like a reasonable time for a young, well-educated person to get back on their financial feet, but it depends on their personal financial situation. If (they) have to go and pay off a bank or lost a home and lost a job, things can get pretty severe," said Hilary Martin, a certified financial planner at the San Jose-based Family Wealth Consulting Group. "Just having them move in with no (exit) agreement and kind of a hush-hush idea about money because you don't want to pressure them is not really a good idea. Be supportive but also have expectations."

If this isn't a perfect example of why the U-T is bleeding readership, I don't know what is. Apparently the Republican Party in San Diego (who also is bleeding voter identification) and their endorsed mayoral candidate now have the U-T doing its bidding.

Essentially, it's the post-9/11 odyssey of four adventurous but unworldly buddies -- one of them, Monir, vanished during the adventure, and is presumed dead -- who traveled from London to Karachi, where Asif was to be married, and took a side trip to Afghanistan on an impulse. After getting caught in a Northern Alliance roundup of Taliban fighters, they did several months of hard time in Afghan prisons, then did much longer -- and much harder -- time at Guantanamo until British authorities verified their claims of innocence, brought them home and set them free without charge. (At the moment when, according to the FBI, the trio was spotted at a rally attended by Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atta, Shafiq was working in a British electrical store, and Asif and Ruhel, who had criminal records, were doing community service in Tipton as parolees.)

"It would be undeniable that they were targeted for criticism and undermined by Dr. McCollom," assistant Prosecutor Barbara Marburger wrote in a memo to commissioners last March. "Since Dr. McCollom has supervisory responsibilities, since she reportedly engaged in ethnically charged comments, and since Dr. Miller failed to take appropriate action concerning Dr. McCollom's activities, a fact-finder could conclude that illegal retaliation ... played a part."

It's a serious tool. And it's a cinch to master.

We live and do business in the information age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black and white TV.

Cotsonika, Yahoo! Sports: "The Sharks were the only team that made the conference final in each of the past two years. They improved on paper in the off-season, and even though they didn't show it on the ice, they got their act together down the stretch when in danger of missing the playoffs. Like the Capitals, they have not succeeded as favorites and can now relish the role of the underdog. Their top players have far more playoff experience than the Blues."

While I have not been enamored with President Obama’s performance, the Republican presidential primaries have reaffirmed that he is a superior alternative to any of the Republican candidates. Gingrich, Santorum, Romney and Paul would, no doubt, see my position on expanding the safety net in the short run, to assist those who are unable to find work because of the economic downturn, and my call for reducing income inequality, as evidence that I favor turning America into a “European-style welfare state ... that would poison the very spirit of America,” as Mitt Romney has said about Obama’s efforts.

“It really allows you to focus on yourself, not so much prep work for the other team,” the Glen Burnie native and Old Mill graduate said. “We had two stretches where we went through three games in seven or eight days, and we really just focused on ourselves and executed and sharpened some things up and then not as much personnel work for the other team. We really focused on ourselves. So I think that plays to our strengths at times because we know how good we can be and if we just perfect the things we need to do, I think we can beat anybody we need to. So in terms of playing Denver on Wednesday, we’re going to come to work on Monday, we’re going to watch the game, we’re going to correct some things and then we’re going to get after it in practice on Monday.”

Together, these narcissists will manufacture a drama that will undermine the conference and NBA Finals, the NBA draft and Fourth of July parades in small towns and big cities across America. James and the Cavs lost Game 6 of the conference semifinals to the Boston Celtics, 94-85, but he hardly seemed devastated in the losing locker room. James had a triple-double that was devalued with nine turnovers. He shot 44 percent for the series, turned the ball over 27 times and behaved like a lousy leader.

It enraged him, he said, and whatever happened next was a blur.
Senate leaders said they would call the chamber back for a special session to re-approve the bill. That could require unanimous agreement from Republicans to use a procedure that does not require senators to be present for a voice vote.

Translation: The main health issue that caused Meyer to resign at UF was a sick program he left on life support. Meyer bolted UF because his program was imploding. He left new coach Will Muschamp with a crumbling shell of a team that was bereft of discipline, decency and depth.
Now, understand. There is work to do here. Gerald Wallace and Wesley Matthews will have to continue to mug opposing players on the perimeter.

Nua, the chic wine bar in North Beach, also has a new toque; the food's still good but doesn't quite hit the heights it did when I reviewed it. Cav, too, has a new chef, and the cooking is just as good, including what I think may be the best charcuterie plate in the city. However, I didn't include it in my list, because the wine bar/restaurant is actually a couple of years old.

Right now it's expensive to buy an electric vehicle, but government incentives are bringing the price down. Based on average usage of 40 miles a day for one year, to operate the electric vehicle when you're paying for kilowatt hour is going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of maybe $200 to $400 a year. For a gasoline-powered vehicle you would spend $1,200 to $1,500 for the same amount of usage.

There are, of course, more films planned, but so far, the movie franchise doesn’t deliver the fantastic imagery and moral parables of the “Harry Potter” series (or even the sexual power and cultural subtext of the “Twilight” saga). Director Gary Ross is visually impoverished and the too-blatant overemphasis on satirizing reality TV only distracts from the book’s other, far more interesting themes.
Like Ward, junior attackman Mike Sawyer chose to take a positive approach to the loss.
"They tried to throw me sliders every at-bat, so I had to adjust to hit the ball," Cespedes said. "It was great to hit a home run here for the Japanese fans."

We lost "Lost," "24" and "Law & Order" at the end of last season. "Lost" producers, of course, long ago announced that they'd be calling it quits after six ABC seasons. And Fox's "24" had pretty much run its prime-time course. But NBC's "Law & Order" had some gas left in the story tank, and it certainly deserved the chance to break the "Gunsmoke" record for most seasons by a drama. It's just one example of how shows that the networks canceled were better than the fall newcomers replacing them.
Kelley agreed to cooperate the day of the raids. He, Pumper, Russo and Neiheiser have since pleaded guilty to corruption-related charges. Only Neiheiser is in prison, as he was sentenced to 37 months. The others are expected to testify against Dimora.
Format: There is only one way to top an album with a seventeen-minute centerpiece, and that’s to release two and a quarter hours of music, all at once, spread over three disks. “Have One On Me” is a mini boxed-set: open up the case, and you’ll find a lyric booklet, and sleeves marked one, two, and three. Each is decorated with a cute photo of Joanna Newsom in a short dress and pointy shoes, putting up her hair; she is not above fanservice. Ever meticulous, Newsom has divided the collection evenly: six songs per disc. In a concession to the iPod age, some of the advance hype suggested that “Have One On Me” was really three separate albums released all at once, and you weren’t expected to sit there and listen to the artist scraping her harp for one hundred and thirty minutes straight, not really -- I mean, it’s a fast-paced world, and there are season premieres to catch that can’t be Tivoed. If you jump around, an out-for-vengeance Joanna Newsom isn’t going to burst through your front door with a flaming sword, but it is pretty clear to this first time caller and long-time listener that she means for you to experience “Have One On Me” as a complete statement. She’s an album artist; she never would have ended a set with a track that begs for the kind of resolution that “Occident” -- the HOOM disc 2 closer -- does. Consider also that ideas developed in the very first song on HOOM1 are brought to a satisfying conclusion on the last song of HOOM3, and that that last song on HOOM3 is a reprise of the epic track in the middle of HOOM2. (And yes, I do enjoy referring to this massive, sometimes-overwhelming set as HOOM; it sounds like a supercomputer crossed with a loom crossed with a vacuum cleaner, which, come to think of it, isn’t a halfway-bad description of Newsom’s brain.) If you made it through “69 Love Songs” or, for you Jersey emo types, “The Mother, The Mechanic, And The Path,” “Have One On Me” ought to be no sweat. I do recognize that attention spans are shortening by the hour, and that those who would once have gladly listened to “Tales From Topographic Oceans” in a trance are now busy channel-surfing and text-messaging and voting for the latest American Idol. You might conclude that anybody who’d actually bother to absorb “Have One On Me” in one sitting is either 1.) a technophobe who cannot get with the earth-shattering, synapse-scrambling, aphasia-precipitating possibilities of the new technologies, 2.) some kind of crazy, or 3.) hopelessly in love with Joanna Newsom. I could be any one of those things, or several of them; I’ll let you decide at the end of the review. But even if I am, that does not preclude the possibility that the full megadose of HOOM is good tonic for your soul. If it is, I mean; I haven’t begun to render judgment here. An epic album deserves an epic write-up, and if the artist can go long, this cagy interlocutor can, too.

Keep the Hawks here and forget about an NHL franchise; whether we 'deserve' a NHL team or not is irrelevant, a true 'pro' game would ruin the atmosphere and the fun and frivolity. Support the Winterhawks and those long term fans AND the families that help the young men adjust to Portland and to being on their own. Many 'team' families have been doing this for over 20 years! THAT'S another story I want to hear about; those dedicated 'foster' Mom's and Dads.

Police smashed one window of a Honda Accord to rescue Diaz's son, who was found about 6 p.m. Aug. 30 in the parking lot of the Northgate supermarket on Escondido Boulevard near Washington Avenue.
Tressel wasnt surviving this. There was no way. He blatantly lied to his superiors and NCAA investigators, breaching explicit terms of his contract. But Tressel became leverage for the university with the NCAA. His bosses defiantly stood by him. Forcing out a coach they so staunchly supported just weeks earlier  and who was so successful against the Buckeyes arch enemy  sends another signal to the NCAA that Ohio State is sternly policing itself, purging the program of the root of the compliance problems.

"The Artist": Michel Hazanavicius's mostly silent, entirely black-and-white romantic comedy is pleasing in many ways: as a love letter to the movies, a tribute to the power of silence, and a showcase for two actors, Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo, who've taken their retro roles seriously and played them eloquently.
This week, the Liberty Towers apartment complex in Newton contacted an exterminator to battle an infestation. Last week, the AMC/Loews movie complex at Monmouth Mall closed after bedbugs were found.
