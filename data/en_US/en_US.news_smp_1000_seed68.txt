The last of those passed the House, too, but the other three are awaiting action. Of those, the failure to pass a long-term highway bill is particularly glaring. House Speaker John Boehner announced in November that he was proceeding with the bill, but so far he has been able to pass only a short-term extension.

The idea of a Hot Tomato is good -- a deconstructed bloody Mary with vodka, tomato water, lemon and a dash of Tabasco served in a martini glass with a jalapeno pepper floating in the middle.

These mines are very predatory as they are coming into an economically depressed region of the state and making all sorts of promises about the jobs they will create. And I have no doubt that, were they allowed to proceed, they would create jobs. But for how long? And are we really willing to risk the pristine nature of the Boundary Waters and the safety of Lake Superior which is still recovering from the Reserve Mining fiasco for a decade of employment? Tens of thousands of Minnesotans currently make their livings off the tourism trade in Northern Minnesota. I have to believe that the tourism industry will suffer greatly if suddenly our land is ripped bare and our lakes contaminated with runoff sulfuric acid from mines run by people with the worst possible track records.

Weight gain causes fatty acids to overflow into muscles and the liver, rather than stay in fat cells and cholesterol molecules where they are normally stowed, Plutzky says.

What he observed was simple and unmistakable: love. He heard it in the witnesses' voices, and he saw it in their small, unconscious gestures of affection. He saw the love of two people who have dedicated their lives to one another, and more crucially, he saw the love of parents for their children.

On the holidays, it’s time to eat, time to have fun, time to relax and then it’s like, ‘Gotta start the diet Jan. 1.’ It’s funny how people feel so guilty for eating."

ø•He's already got his stolen base total into double-digits - can Starlin Castro keep up this pace? His speed skills are consistent with years past; what's different is that he's running much more frequently. While he ran less than 20% when reached first base in 2010-11, he's taking off more than 50% of the time in 2012. That rate is unsustainable, especially since his success rate (about 70%) is nothing special. Castro certainly looks like he'll beat last year's career-best total of 22 steals. But he's not going to double that number, despite his early pace.

The Irish government protests it doesn't need aid, at least not yet, because it has sufficient funds through mid-2011 and is planning euro6 billion ($8 billion) in 2011 cuts and tax hikes.

Russo is community-minded, and he takes his commitment to airing music alternatives seriously. While he didn’t initially know how to transform that mission into action on "Anything Anything," he feels like he’s now on the right track.

While Sherwood locals won’t see any tax hikes, adding three years to the taxing district does pull money away from things like the state schools fund, which reallocates money back to school districts by per pupil.

The business is driving the basketball. Not the other way around. And there's a tremendous ongoing power play among the personalities below Allen.

For starters, they don't want to undercut their own candidates in what many consider the biggest swing state for the general election.

To some Americans, this agenda will seem ambitious. To others, it may seem frightening. But House leaders believe their main risk is appearing too timid to their own members. Even if this three-part strategy proceeds with efficiency and success, in two years it will result in a budget freeze, an unsuccessful guerrilla campaign against health reform and the bare beginnings of the entitlement debate. Will Tea Party revolutionaries view this as victory? Will they be tempted by the Ross Perot option -- a third-party movement that would increase the odds of Obama's re-election?

Hey, Jack: As of now, the Cavs stand to shed $31.5 million in payroll when O'Neal's and Ilgauskas' contracts expire next summer. However, the Cavs are way, way over the salary cap and deep into the luxury tax. So that doesn't mean they'll be $30 million under the cap.

It is because of this fact that there will be heavy consideration to make a trade before the deadline.

“It is unfortunately not surprising to see more effusive praise for Russia’s leaders coming from the White House,” policy director Lanhee Chen said. “President Obama has utterly failed to stand up to Russia on issues ranging from Iran’s nuclear weapons program to Syria to Russia’s own backsliding into authoritarianism. At the same time, he’s given away concession after concession to Russia. We can expect more such ‘flexibility’ if President Obama is re-elected.“
Smith does a nice job with a very tricky, schematic character — an unreconstructed racist whose disdain for the hotel’s Indian staff transforms when she bonds with a maid over their shared life histories as marginalized domestic workers. Nighy and Wilton also work to deepen a potentially shallow depiction of the henpecked man joined to a shrew of a wife — in gesture and in tone, Nighy shows that he understands he’s failed to give her the life she’s expected, and Wilton shows us a woman who let disappointment turn to anger and reproach. In a crucial scene, we see the disintegrated couple remember being in love, and it’s a nice moment.
"We have a couple of other guys who are familiar with it," Link said. "But our plan is to try to get as many people as possible fluent in Spanish - or at least skilled in Spanish."

Todd Colletti is baffled by this week's politicization of the hoodie.
It's a lesson in the various frustrations of this place. As airports go, LAX, which entered the jet age in 1961, is an antiquity. From taxi ways to terminals, it's all squeezed into one of the smallest footprints of any major U.S. airport: 3,425 acres compared to Dallas-Ft. Worth's 18,076. There is nowhere else to go but up.
Even at that rate, though, the subsidence eventually could spell problems for the monument, especially after it was rocked by a magnitude 5.8 earthquake in August. Preliminary data collected Wednesday showed that the monument has sunk two millimeters since the last survey was done in 2009.
Bates is jailed on $75,000 bond and does not yet have a listed attorney.
What makes fear of "Brokeback" even more odd are the misconceptions that have developed among those who haven't seen the film. On top of being the favorite movie of the year of many critics, Ang Lee's film has mistakenly received a reputation as some kind of nonstop guy-on-guy sex romp.
Hollow eyes stare into space. Mournful cries yearn for grace. And yet, little brown boys with baby faces, and little brown girls with curls and lace frolic on some golden, sun-drenched days.

--Speaking of changing recipes, PepsiCo says it knows how to sell more Tropicana brand orange juice: Add water. Some consumers prefer orange juice that’s less thick. Others want juice with the "goodness" of oranges and fewer calories, the company says. It believes consumers will pay the same -- or more -- for such versions. PepsiCo’s Tropicana, the best-selling OJ in the U.S., is trying to regain space in refrigerators after a repackaging fiasco three years ago hurt the brand and allowed Coca-Cola to outflank it. The brand lost market share last year to Coke’s Minute Maid and Simply Orange brands. So now PepsiCo is focusing on products with less juice, more innovation and, therefore, higher profit margins.

ChefStable gets its credibility from the relationships built between us and chefs. Whether we succeed or not depends on how I get along with the chefs. All I can do is offer common-sense advice based on my experience. With new projects, I also make a point of bringing up the hard issues -- the "what-ifs" -- regarding the future that are easy to ignore. But each project is built on the chef's vision. The challenge is keeping the place relevant and the quality high. So far, every restaurant project we have worked on has been profitable. Each has made money in the first year.

The Dodgers carried a 5-4 lead into the ninth and asked right-hander Francisco Felix to close it. Felix, who last year pitched at triple-A Albuquerque (5.99 ERA), gave up a single, hit a batter and then a game-winning two-run double to Brad Davis for a 6-5 loss. That’s Brad Davis the minor league catcher, not the former Mavericks point guard.

The roasted-malt character of this almost-black schwarzbier displays itself with a cocoa-powder aroma. The flavor, however, is not nearly as roasty as the color suggests. The beer's lager yeast, pilsner malt and German hops combine to create a clean-tasting beer with a crisp, dry finish. If you've been fooled by the misconception that dark equals heavy, this beer will set you straight. Available on draft at the brewery and several bars and restaurants around town. At 4.4 percent ABV, you could drink several Black Lagers on St. Patrick's Day.

And this is the team that gets selected to play in the Sugar Bowl?

Terri Harrington, a vice president with MacKenzie Commercial Real Estate Services, said that though Pratt Street is "thriving," the backfill could take time. "Transactions of this nature do not happen quickly, and it's unfortunate we'll have a dark space on Pratt Street in the meantime," she said.
Fortunately, the move for high speed rail in the United States is growing. In January, President Barack Obama announced plans for an $8 billion investment in U.S. high-speed train systems.

Steve Burton, a “GH” star since 1991 — he plays mobster Jason — put the band together with 32-year-olds Bradford Anderson (mob pal Spinelli) and Brandon Barash (mob nemesis Johnny), and Scott Reeves (General Hospital top doc Steve) in 2010. Backed by four musicians, who introduce the Levittown show with a Jimi Hendrix-inspired “Star-Spangled Banner,” Port Chuck is a mostly classic-rock cover band — and they’re not at all bad.
It's key that we all understand the origin of the movement  and that the movement itself has grown into a more amorphous and uncontrolled version of that orchestrated start.

This Roscoe Village organic bakery bills itself as offering "punk rock pastry." And if that means many of the goodies are surprisingly inventive, I would have to agree. Sure, you'll find the standards: brownies, cookies, whoopie pies and cheesecake bars, all generously sized, by the way. And there's a gorgeous, postcard-perfect vista of cupcakes on display — about a dozen flavors available each month, four to six of them vegan. However, foodies will appreciate the assortment of thoughtful creations such as chocolate chip cookies with bacon (yes, the bacon is organic), blueberry pie with lavender streusel, basil and goat cheese croissants, tequila-lime cupcakes and ginger-cream scones. And speaking of scones, the vegan Take a Hike scones, made with whole-wheat flour, oats, seeds and dried fruit, are the bakery's best-seller. Most items are sweetened with evaporated cane juice. Extra bonus: With its tattoo-art touches and neon-hued walls and tables, the shop has a punk rock feel too.

Mitchell says the charges are untrue and part of a political smear. The allegations had been the subject of anonymous e-mails and rumors for weeks.

Balla is also a master at pickles - there's often at least five on the menu. For his part, bread master Robertson makes a fried potato bread. The restaurant has recently been remodeled to include a space next door and a sandwich and retail shop.

Strictly speaking, he says, the only products that the FDA actually "approves" are drugs and serious high-tech medical devices such as implantable defibrillators.
