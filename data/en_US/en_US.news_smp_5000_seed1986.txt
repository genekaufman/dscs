One acquaintance, favoring privacy, said that if the worst were to happen to her husband and someone wielding a camera dared to elbow in on her family's grief, she'd "open up a can of Army wife whoop-ass."

There's two or three different routes I’d go. One is to get together with a buddy who can code a little and make an iPhone game.

The owner is Mahendra Singh, who has run restaurants in Toronto, New York City and Philadelphia. The decor — hardwood floors, orange walls — is stylish without being stuffy. The traditional Indian bread known as naan is often predictable — it seems to be baked in the same central oven — but Cinnamon’s version is thick, chewy and distinctive. The dal makhani is a seductive, buttery blend of lentils, tomatoes, ginger and garlic. One of the better tandoori chickens in New Jersey can be found at Cinnamon. The desserts — the kheer, or cardamom-flavored rice pudding, and the gulab jamun, or warm pastry soaked in honey — are sweet treats.

Hey, Michael: I also share your doubts about Griffin. His physical talents (throwing, running) are obvious. I don't like his size, however, or his inability to stay in the pocket and let pass routes develop. He is a smart player, however, and all indications are that he can learn the pro game. His physical attributes might get him on the field sooner than the typical rookie, but he will need superb coaching to develop.

The gist of the book is a narration Grace puts together at the behest of her lawyers as they try to find an argument to save her from the gallows for a crime yet to be revealed. We learn through her narrative that she was returning from London with her wealthy husband when the Empress Alexandra luxury liner suffered an unexplained explosion and sank in the North Atlantic.

Given the large weekend crowds, we're pretty sure you already know about On the Rise, the lake's superlative breakfast destination. No? Then stop reading now. Move on to Starbucks, nothing to see here. Save the delicious beignets, baked vanilla bean French toast and eggs Benedict, served five different ways, for us. Most entrees come with a biscuit or cinnamon roll in case the side dishes of applewood smoked bacon, chicken and apple sausage and roasted potatoes are not enough to sate your appetite.

The Molokai Ranch resort tried several management companies before closing in 2008. The main lodge won design awards, and guests could split their time between the hotel and three tent camps spread around the 65,000-acre property. Then the camps were reduced to just one, near the beach. If this great lodge had been built close to the ocean, it might have had a chance. But for now, it sits shuttered.

Like the two previous films about the CGI rodents with the helium singing voices, "Chipwrecked" falls well short of the bar for wink-wink postmodernism set by "Shrek." But it does make surprisingly inoffensive viewing for adults, who will find the semi-sly references to Sarah Palin and "You Got Served" a welcome distraction from the hackneyed plot, which sees the three Chipmunks and their girl-group counterparts, the Chipettes, marooned on a desert island complete with active volcano, hidden treasure and a savage native (a snarling honey badger). There's also a castaway (Jenny Slate) who one-ups Tom Hanks by conversing with not one but five face-painted balls (tennis, golf, basket-, base- and Nerf foot-).
In AMC's "Mad Men," why are characters clothed during a sex scene, he asks, while when a riding mower runs over someone's foot during the same show, we're allowed to see gushing blood?

Providence bartender Vincenzo Marianella agrees about the ice and the bubbles. "When you're shaking it," he says, "you change the texture of the spirits. Shaking adds not only ice and dissolved water but bubbles. Try putting 2 ounces of gin in two jars and shake one while you stir the other; you'll find they have different flavor and texture -- for a minute or two. After that they taste the same. But the first sip is the one you're going to remember for a long time."

A thought for all of us sentenced to a 24/7 news cycle wherein every comment, statement or aside is endlessly vetted: Give 'em a break. Presidential campaigns are political pressure cookers. Politicians are human beings. They can get tired, cranky and careless. They remind us that nobody is perfect. As much as we might like to revel in the difficulties of our political opponents, obvious misstatements should not become prime campaign fodder. Our unsettled economy and numerous military engagements around the world provide us plenty of real issues to debate. Given the high stakes involved, we can do better than this.
The constants in Niles' peripatetic childhood in Dayton, Tenn., and Los Angeles — after 15 residential moves, she stopped counting — were ballet, jazz, tap dance and competition baton twirling. ("Very Southern of me, right?!") She didn't want a career behind a desk, like her mother, who worked as a claims adjuster, paralegal and office manager while also playing piano in church. While Niles was studying at USC, she was given an increasing number of administrative duties by Erwin Washington, executive director of Lula Washington Dance Theatre, the 32-year-old repertory ensemble devoted to dance that tackles social issues and African American culture. It became clear that her star as an executive was rising faster than it would as a dancer. She became company manager when she graduated college.

By last season it was clear that Third Rail was outgrowing its home at North Portland's Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center. When the center's available dates for this season didn't match the company's needs, Third Rail decided to head downtown. The move provides about twice as many seats (220 as it's set up for "Dead Funny") and a nicer-looking facility. A few days ago the 700th season subscriber signed on, up from 535 at the end of the '07-'08 season. The company's budget has jumped from $202,000 to $350,000, thanks in part to grants from the Meyer Memorial Trust and the Miller Foundation to help with the move and to pay for administrative work.

Studies show that first and second generation immigrants favor making English the official language of the United States — and that they do so, in fact, at a higher rate than the general American population. If opposition to illegal immigration were what the Official English movement is about, surely this would not be the case. People come to America with the expectation that we speak English here and that they need to learn English in order to be successful.

Rivera's works in the Beatnik Studios show are bold in color and expressionistic in handling. Full of references to pre-Columbian cultures, each work depicts a male figure subtitled with a Nahuatl (Aztec) word. "Yaotl" is Nahuatl for warrior, and it depicts a fearsome visage.

One of the most dramatic examples is holding the plane. If you're a garden-variety passenger, and you're late for your flight, you're out of luck. You may even have to pay for a new ticket. But an assistant for a "high-level executive" sent me the story of how they held the plane for her boss.

If the real question is how often schools suspend students — which obviously affects black students more than other groups — the answer is simple: far too often. Ordinarily, the public thinks of zero tolerance as invoking consequences for drugs or weapons. But in recent years, it has been applied in alarming numbers to much less serious violations — especially disruptive behavior. The idea is that by removing the troublemaker for a day or more, the school becomes a calmer place where others can achieve.

"Nobody liked the first period. The players didn't like it. I didn't like it. No one liked it," Laviolette said. "So, it was good to get through the first period, only down 1-0. And then for me, it started in the second period. We had the fire it took to be successful."

Huge Tree's green onion pastry, a little sesame-studded morsel of golden flaky pastry, is halfway between an onion scallion pancake and a croissant. Take a bite and admire the way it spans the gentle, crumbling crisp of the outer shell, to the soft semi-stretchy flakes below, to the near melting moistness of the inner layers. You can also get the same dough stuffed with pleasantly bland shredded daikon or charmingly sweet curried pork, or just sweetened and hollow.

Of the roughly 10,000 city owners who get the credit, more than 700 have bought houses since 2007, and dozens just in the past year, according to The Sun's analysis — a sign that a program created to keep people from losing their homes is being used by some to help acquire one.

The dry and hot weather was refreshing, just in time for the Memorial Day weekend. Not only did it help owners at the cash register, but also in the maintenance department.

Title insurance probably is one of the least understood parts of the real estate purchase process. We buy most insurance to safeguard us against future problems. Car or home insurance safeguards us against future losses. Health insurance safeguards us against the cost of future medical needs. Title insurance, on the other hand, safeguards the ownership of your home or other real estate against past mistakes or fraud. You are insured against things that may have occurred before you bought the property.

"What you'd like to see, rather than driving Treasury rates lower, would be a stable environment that would let mortgage rates drift down on their own," Colbert said.
Outlook: Cardinals believe strong 7-2 finish creates optimism. Still unsettled, though, is quarterback situation. Whisenhunt says there will be open competition in training camp between Kolb and Skelton. Offensive line has been inconsistent, and that's putting it charitably. Arizona still is looking for reliable No. 2 WR behind Larry Fitzgerald. That could lead to selection of Floyd if he's around. Addressing OT spot seems better bet, though.

But the plate is so full of fresh, brightly colored vegetables that I could see the argument for laying it out that way. Visual presentation is a feature of Thai cuisine  whole watermelons are often carved into a bouquet of chrysanthemums. Nearly every dish is garnished with carrot flowers or cranes and delicate ruffles of kale. Red pepper strips set off the pumpkin-colored, cream-enriched sauce.
Perhaps the toughest sales pitch of the week will come Thursday as Obama stands before the pipes in Cushing to talk about building infrastructure like the Keystone pipeline — designed, as a White House official put it, to address the "bottleneck" of oil created by increased oil production in the Midwest.

It's a lesson in the various frustrations of this place. As airports go, LAX, which entered the jet age in 1961, is an antiquity. From taxi ways to terminals, it's all squeezed into one of the smallest footprints of any major U.S. airport: 3,425 acres compared to Dallas-Ft. Worth's 18,076. There is nowhere else to go but up.
Czaplicki — who also serves as director of the Jersey City Department of Housing, Economic Development and Commerce — confirmed in a letter to the governor that he helped find jobs for both after he became a commissioner.
I'm reading this morning's Town Talk on Feb. 22. The last article says if you can't play, don't. This is real sportsmanship. I thought this was not a game for just winning. It was to bring out the best in any kid and show them that they can have some self-esteem about other things. And the person who wrote this is probably one of those guys who gets out on the field and yells at the umpires because their son or daughter is not being shown at their potential. Give us a break, everybody. You don't always have to win.
Vampires and zombies flexed their muscles, show choirs became a sensation and pawnbrokers, ill-behaved housewives and too-tanned New Jerseyites littered the landscape.
Steelgrass Farm on Kauai is another ag overachiever, although of a very different sort. Steelgrass, founded by brother and sister Will and Emily Lydgate, is ostensibly a cacao farm — the family is growing enough cacao to distribute the trees to farmers across the island in order to start a single-origin chocolate to be marketed with all the cachet brought by the name Kauai.
In addition to preparing ourselves, we need to prepare our children. It's a difficult conversation to have, and it is one we must learn to undertake. One of the better suggestions I've heard in the wake of the Penn State scandal is that children shouldn't just have one or two parents they feel safe going to for help. They should have five "safe adults," and if one does not help, they can go to the next.
While LCWR did not respond to repeated requests for comment, Sister Simone Campbell, Network's executive director, said she was "stunned" that the Vatican document would single out her group, probably over its support for health care reform.

As one of the few reliable advocates of compromise on the right side of the aisle in the Senate, Ms. Snowe acknowledged that she finds it "frustrating ... that an atmosphere of polarization and my-way-or-the-highway ideologies has become persuasive in campaigns and in our governing institutions.

“It’s just one of those things,” Hughes said. “There’s not much I can do about other than pitch well. As long as I pitch well, there’s going to be a spot. The fact that we have more starters than spots is not something I can control. What I can control is how hard I work.”

In the other direction the fire was creeping toward Chinatown, at once the plague spot and the wonderland of San Francisco. When the flames reached this district, it ignited like kindling wood. It covered over seven or eight blocks, but ten thousand people were packed in it. It was said to be fairly honey-combed with human habitations underneath. Of all the suffering from the fire, I think the despised Chinese faired the worse, for they were the poorest and no American homes were open to them. It was from Chinatown that most of the dead bodies were taken, and no doubt untold numbers are still lying under the debris. Probably, many of them were opium fiends, who were too stupified to make their escape from these underground death-traps.

A: We need to put the district on a path of accountability and transparency. We need to look at the contracts with the law firm. We need to be able to, anytime they hire somebody, put in safeguards so that the board can approve that or at minimum be able to be aware of those hirings. We need to look at how we're doing as a board in the structure. And we ultimately need to look at each individual down the chain of command to make sure that they're competent, accountable and know the rules and the laws of what they're doing.

Five men charged with plotting to bomb a bridge linking two wealthy Cleveland suburbs placed what they thought were real explosives at the site and repeatedly tried to detonate them using text messages from cellphones, according to an FBI affidavit filed in court.
This Roscoe Village organic bakery bills itself as offering "punk rock pastry." And if that means many of the goodies are surprisingly inventive, I would have to agree. Sure, you'll find the standards: brownies, cookies, whoopie pies and cheesecake bars, all generously sized, by the way. And there's a gorgeous, postcard-perfect vista of cupcakes on display — about a dozen flavors available each month, four to six of them vegan. However, foodies will appreciate the assortment of thoughtful creations such as chocolate chip cookies with bacon (yes, the bacon is organic), blueberry pie with lavender streusel, basil and goat cheese croissants, tequila-lime cupcakes and ginger-cream scones. And speaking of scones, the vegan Take a Hike scones, made with whole-wheat flour, oats, seeds and dried fruit, are the bakery's best-seller. Most items are sweetened with evaporated cane juice. Extra bonus: With its tattoo-art touches and neon-hued walls and tables, the shop has a punk rock feel too.

That resilient co-worker, by contrast, appears to be in the genetic majority: DBQ1*0602-negative. Faced with the prospect of less sleep, her body and brain settle into sleep more quickly, slide seamlessly into deep sleep, and stay under until she has to wake up.
Backes has demonstrated other important ingredients to leadership, such as humility. He didn't come to this station with all the answers. He makes room for other voices, seeks counsel, listens to feedback, positive or otherwise. He has placed the welfare of the group above all else.

But the 2.8 percent annualized growth rate in the October-December quarter -- the fastest pace since the spring of 2010 -- isn't being cheered by most economists or investors.

A modern wassail is Our Special Ale from San Francisco's Anchor Brewing Co. Anchor's president, Fritz Maytag, has called his beer a "moving target": the recipe changes yearly to thwart imitators. The 2007 edition has a sharp, sweet aroma (cloves? cinnamon?), almost like an incense, and a fine-tuned equilibrium among the spices, hops and specialty malts. The spice blend is kept secret, but the beer has gotten darker over the years, adding notes of coffee and bittersweet chocolate.

Let's wrap up the other business. At the end of last week's episode, Vinny Guadagnino hooked up with his boss Danny's date. Danny didn't seem to care all that much. Vinny's extended family also shows up and treats the house to some delicious ziti and cold cuts, then Mama Guadagnino cleans the refrigerator. Vinny flirts with The Situation's sister Melissa over the phone, but when she shows up, he thinks she looks too much like The Situation and is turned off. But at the club later (where JWoww is wearing her formal panties again) they seem to hit it off. And The Situation shares with us his holy grail: Gym. Tanning. Laundry. GTL, people. GTL.

After Dominique left, Lohan called back seeking to work things out with Major. "He sounds extremely intoxicated," Major told the 911 dispatcher.
Van Gundy will be fired between now and the end of the season. There's no way he survives this dysfunctional episode. He probably was done in Orlando anyway despite his popularity with some Magic players and four straight playoff appearances that include a trip to the 2009 NBA Finals. Ownership and management almost always side with the star when he becomes at odds with the coach. When Howard agreed to stay for one more season, you had tofigure it was at the cost of Van Gundy's job.
The "quiz" part of the program was beside the point. The meat of "You Bet Your Life" was Marx's sharp interrogation of contestants. The quick-witted comic could extract laughs from the most mundane interview. And if the contestant happened to be a pretty girl, watch out. The Groucho we remember from the movies would materialize, all bouncing eyebrows and bobbing cigar.

Yet "Private Empire" is not so much an indictment as a fascinating look into American business and politics. With each chapter as forceful as a New Yorker article, the book abounds in Dickensian characters. Chief among them is Raymond, known to subordinates as "Iron Ass." Raymond, an engineer turned CEO, responded to the Exxon Valdez embarrassment by turning his corporation into a cult of secrecy, obsession and obstruction. Then there are the bigger players in this global game of Risk, including Bush and Cheney, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, and assorted diplomats and dictators trying to squeeze a decent deal, or even some decency, out of the stone of ExxonMobil.

CIT filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Sunday in New York after teetering on the brink of collapse for months.

In technology, size isn't always an asset, as HP is learning. One of the biggest challenges for Whitman will be to figure out how big HP needs to be. It's a key question that has tripped up a string of CEOs, from Carly Fiorina and her hard-fought battle to buy Compaq Computer, to Mark Hurd and his $20 billion acquisition spree and 50,000 job cuts, and Apotheker's poorly received plan to steer HP away from lower-margin areas of computer hardware.

The broadcasters likely will treat it as an afterthought, but this is an area where CSU could have an advantage. Murray State is only plus-1.8 in rebounding margin. The Racers allow an average of 11.7 offensive rebounds per game. That should benefit CSU's Pierce Hornung, a junior forward who has 86 offensive rebounds this season. He likes to live on the glass, getting extra possessions for the Rams.

My trip started in Brazil, where I gave a presentation at the 62nd Brazilian Botanical Conference in Forteleza. There I met Joaõ Batist Silva, a fascinating 68-year-old Brazilian plant collector. He is the kind of guy they drop by helicopter on one mountain top and pick up a week later on another peak. He travels only with a GPS, a bit of food, his digital camera and a hammock.

A fountain might sound like a surprising addition when you're thinking water conservation, but even though recirculating fountains lose some water to evaporation and splash-out - the East Bay Municipal Utility District estimates that about 1 to 4 gallons per square foot of water per year gets lost to evaporation from pools - it still uses a lot less than the water lost to a large turf grass lawn, and the pleasure that people take in the sound of water can be well worth the trade-off.

2009 Rock Wall Stagecoach Vineyard Napa Valley Zinfandel ($40, 15.8%): Kent Rosenblum and daughter Shauna certainly know the style their partisans love. Here they've tapped the rocky Stagecoach site for a no-holds-barred expression. Intense, lusty cinnamon wood notes, with blackberry jam and a sweet licorice tone. Not subtle, but rewarding. As one taster put it, "This is the wine that will make you do something stupid." Hope not.
My father-in-law, Sam, also loved the kitchen. He would skip Mass on Sundays, but when Greg's mother and the four kids returned from church, he would be sure to greet them in a red apron, martini in hand, while the strains of a Puccini opera and the aroma of a leg of lamb and garlic filled the air.

Moreover, I have a jaundiced view of the financial services industry and I know something about managing money. My time is flexible.

Before games, I set goals for myself, so I set how many goals I want to get, how many assists, interceptions, stuff on defense and it feels great when I reach them. Because I feel like I set my goals so high, in games when I don't do well even though I still might have done well to me I failed, because I didn't reach the goals I wanted to reach. And in school, it's gotten so much better senior year, but as a freshman and sophomore if I got below a 90, I'd go home and cry. I'd be, "No. I got a B." My mom would be like, "Sam, that's ridiculous. You put too much pressure on yourself." (Laughs)

Manufacturing is doing quite well. One sector that didn't add jobs is government, which is still adjusting to tight budgets and probably will for some time. 8.3 percent unemployment is still terrible.

A: I steer away from casual dating right now because invariably soul-ties are created with people, and then it's difficult to get those things uncoiled.

Authentic Neapolitan pizzas --whole and unsliced, with minimal toppings --are the stars. They arrive thin and chewy-crisp, a little sour and mottled with the essential bitter black spots that signal a dance with wood fire. Flavors can be jaw-dropping --perhaps smoky paprika salami mingled with the deep tang of Hungarian pickled peppers, or shiitake mushrooms and salty pancetta set off by a whole duck egg sitting at dead center.

_ "Alien" (1979): This belongs at the top of about five different lists, including best thriller and best horror film, as well. Ridley Scott did so many things right here — from the grimy, lived-in world of the Nostromo mixed with H.R. Giger's eerily seductive design to the perfect cast and Sigourney Weaver's bad-ass performance. I also love the way Scott keeps the alien unseen for so much of the gut-churning build up, then delivers one of the most terrifying creatures ever seen on screen.

Coconut milk also lends its richness to rice dishes. It's widely joked that if you get tired of beans and rice in Belize, you can always have rice and beans. Any Belizean will tell you the two are entirely different.
Notes: Stralman scored his first two career NHL playoff goals — both on the power play — in the Rangers' first-round series win over Ottawa. ... Washington is 6-1 in the playoffs when it scores first. ... The Capitals are 3 for 16 on the power play in the series. ... The Rangers won Game 3 in triple overtime 2-1.
The lack of reliable data is largely because of the way immigration laws are enforced. Various federal agencies work with state and local law-enforcement agencies to target "criminal aliens." They prefer to escort most illegal border crossers out of the country as quickly as possible, without gathering criminal information unless the crossers are high-level offenders.
Buick's Interactive Drive Control, optional on the Regal Turbo and standard on the GS, adds an adaptive suspension. In the GS, it has regular, Sport and GS settings. The Regal Turbo gets regular, Touring and Sport settings. In the Regal GS, GS mode reduces power-steering assist and stiffens the suspension, but the differences in ride comfort are slim. GS mode improves steering feedback at higher speeds, but no matter the setting the wheel still turns with light effort around town. That's something I prefer, though driving enthusiasts may want higher-effort steering.
Pew’s demographers have carefully combed through statistics compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau, the Department of Homeland Security and the Mexican government, and have come up with estimates of the flow of migrants from and back to Mexico. Their work seems to be as close to definitive as possible.

"We have a major event to focus on that will showcase Baltimore to the nation and beyond and we aren't going to be distracted from our task," he wrote.
It's one thing to channel style icons of years past -- Dita Von Teese makes a living off it -- but it's another to appropriate a red carpet look that's only four years old. It's doubtful that Emma Stone realized she was doing this when she donned an admittedly beautiful Giambattista Valli gown for the 2012 Oscars, but any fashion insider who wasn't too addled by Jennifer Lopez's cleavage or Stacy Keibler's retina-searing gold lame could instantly see the DNA of Nicole Kidman's 2008 Balenciaga in Stone's gown.
"It will make the playoffs more exciting, and I think everybody's got a fair shot," Webster Groves coach Cliff Ice said. "That's what we were looking for."
Cook the shrimp: Add shrimp mixture, scraping the sides of the bowl to get some of the olive oil, wine, salt and pepper into the skillet.
The fire was devastating, burning at least parts of about 23 buildings, leaving at least 20 people without homes and dozens more at least temporarily without electricity and contending with smoke damage.
"At one level it's very unfortunate for David Cameron, the timing of all of this," said Steven Fielding, director of the Center for British Politics at the University of Nottingham. "This could have happened at any point in the last 10 years, that the prime minister of the day could get caught in a close embrace with Rupert Murdoch — they've all been in a close embrace with Rupert Murdoch."
Kevin Walsh of the Fair Share Housing Center – one of the group’s challenging parts of the October decision — said while the state no longer faces a deadline, the part of the appellate court’s order that would force Department of Community Affairs Commissioner Lori Grifa to update the court on the council’s progress in drawing up new rules should still stand.
It didn't work out that way. I was talking to her because of certain problems in her life. She seems like a nice young woman, but she is not tripping down the street smiling at everybody she meets. Instead, she's doing her best, but struggling.

The Chen case "has been a blow for China's legal and government officials," said Zhang Mingxuan, one of China's better-known so-called house-church pastors, in an interview. "Chen Guangcheng isn't a Christian, but we Chinese Christians pray for all those in pursuit of the truth."
Tommasini drove in the Beavers' first run on a bases-loaded walk and Ryan Barnes drove in the second on a sacrifice fly to center.
The reason for the scarce coverage is that many insurers -- fearful of having to face financial losses similar to those resulting from Hurricane Katrina, and wary of the possibility of losses from terrorist attacks -- are dropping their coverage for big natural disasters, Biren said.
“I’ve never run an English-speaking world campaign before, so I have nothing to compare it to,” he said. “I’m happy with it, but not as happy with it as I could be. We’ve had a decent amount of participation.”

Peditto said Maryland hunters should appreciate that the available wildlife-management areas to pursue their passion have nearly doubled from 60,000 acres to 112,000 acres, and that public hunting lands have also increased to about 500,000 acres. In the mid-1950s, only about 15,000 deer were killed by hunters; last year it was about 100,000.

Love said she thinks folks were just weren't clear about where the carpet was. She was already inside Public Auditorium, on her way to dinner, when her producer turned her right around. They exited the venue and came back inside by way of the red carpet amid flashbulbs and cheers. Letting fans see her "live and up-close," said the 71-year-old pro, "is just part of being in show business."
Their family is in shock, Souders wrote, adding that "Ronnie" was loved by many people and will be "greatly missed."
Jewish groups and grocery experts say the demand for kosher products has grown as younger generations return to their cultural roots and seek out foods with more detailed food labeling. That's dovetailed with Americans' appetite for more natural and organic foods.

Officer Christopher Humphreys and Sgt Kyle Nice failed to follow their training, as well as bureau policies, yet were not held accountable for all their missteps that caused Chasse’s death, Steenson argued. Humphreys and Nice were given a two week unpaid suspension for not ensuring Chasse was taken to the hospital; Humphreys is currently off on disability.
The fallout will become clearer in the coming weeks, but there's no question that Tuesday's election marked a turning point for Kadima, a party that holds more Knesset seats than any other but nevertheless has been made largely irrelevant by the Likud-led right-wing coalition.
"While we haven't seen a map, Betty Sutton is running because the stakes are at an all-time high for the hard-working, middle-class people she has been fighting for and representing from Northeast Ohio," said her spokesman, Anthony DeAngelo. "She's prepared for whatever lies ahead."
There is no starker example of how Democrats on the San Diego City Council put public employees ahead of the public than in how they have blocked implementation of a 2006 "managed competition" ballot initiative allowing the city to provide some services using less expensive private providers. The measure won by a 60 percent to 40 percent landslide. In an era of constant budget headaches, the opportunities it provides to save money are immense and need to be pursued.
That the elimination of food deserts is not as effective as once hoped for has been well-researched. It's been long known that opening a new grocery store in a neighborhood barely nudges vegetable consumption — a 2002 study out of Leeds, England, measured the increase at a scant one-third of a cup daily — if at all.
Jo-Ann released its earnings report after the market had closed. Company shares closed Wednesday at $40.01, up 72 cents or 1.8 percent.

Occupants on Saturday blasted everything they say is wrong with the city, the government and America.
Barry Bonds always will be a Hall of Fame candidate. He surely is one of the 10 best players of his generation and probably several others. But will he be a Hall of Famer? That is a question I don't have to worry about answering for another three years or so, until he would become eligible. The biggest question of all, though, may be how would the Hall of Famers receive Bonds if he were elected?. My guess is not very well. American is a forgiving nation but Bonds, and for that matter, Roger Clemens, have shown very little if any contrition for their actions or suspected actions. That creates the sense that they feel they are bigger than the game. And they're not.
Luis, 17, remembered how his brother would come into his room while he was on the computer.
A former member of the central executive committee of Siemens AG, Uriel Sharef, and two former chief executive officers of Siemens Argentina were among those charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the wire fraud statute, the Justice Department said. They were also charged with money laundering, conspiracy and wire fraud.
I wish I could have been there last night when District Attorney Tony Rackauckas got home and his young son asked him, "Daddy, why are you holding up boxes of Saran Wrap on the TV news?" Because without a script, I'm sure he fumbled out something like, "Uh, Saran Wrap is a legally trademarked name, son. It wasn't Saran Wrap. Eat your carrots."

"My heart started racing. I walked up behind him and 'pow' I hit him in the back of his head," he said as he pulled his fist back and threw a punch in the air while his friends broke into laughter. He said he had started playing at age 13 and knew he could injure someone.
Having Wade there is probably a prudent measure by the Heat. James' psychological fragility can pop up at any time, such as when he ripped his Cavs teammates for "dying down in the moment."
The engine is also one of the highlights of the Azera; power is smoothly modulated and is more than enough for a car this size, with zero to 60 mph coming in 6.6 seconds, according to Motor Trend.
Some come for a beer or to talk guns. They'll taste the venison chili simmering in a crock pot or the burgers and hot dogs on the barbecue. But others come to see Lucky Cole's collection of hundreds of photos of women in various stages of undress. A few even elect to pay for their own photo session.
Still, Apple's market position is so strong that it can easily ride out potential supply disruptions, said David Wolf, a technology marketing consultant in Beijing.

Carrillo was pepper-sprayed in the face. He spat a mixture of spray, saliva and blood at one of the deputies. The deputies punched him several times before ending the struggle by handcuffing him. Three deputies were taken to a hospital for treatment, including hepatitis vaccinations. Carrillo's allegations of abuse were first reported in May by LA Weekly.
Almost imperceptibly, things are starting to change, says Sue Levin, executive director of the Oregon chapter of Stand for Children, a nonprofit advocacy group.
Tim Spinner, 33, moving with vibrant salsas, inventive ceviches and duck-stuffed chiles en nogada in his wake, is now finally basking in his own light. It’s no wonder the skeletons look so joyous in the colorful murals that line the walls at La Calaca Feliz cafe (which means “the Happy Skeleton”), the sunny Nuevo Mex restaurant he and partner, Brian Sirhal, opened just over three months ago in Fairmount.
Record of the Year: "Rolling in the Deep," Adele
I hung a right onto Highway 49, heading toward the heart of California's Gold Country. Historic 49, as it's often called, meanders through scenic little Gold Rush towns with names like Drytown and Sutter Creek before continuing on toward Jackson and Angels Camp, where one Samuel Clemens originally made a name for himself under the pen name Mark Twain, writing about a jumping frog. But I wasn't out for the scenery, or a history lesson.

I had come to the Big Island for a meeting with Pele herself, the Hawaiian goddess of fire and volcanoes. The trip was set up by Wellness With Aloha, which calls itself a Hawaiian spiritual concierge service.

Answer: If you are OK with a plant that flowers, and if you can provide a trellis or support of some kind, three vines come to mind: yellow orchid vine (Callaeum macroptera), pink trumpet vine (Podranea ricasoliana) and lilac trumpet vine (Clytostemma sp). All should take full sun and are vigorous growers.

Schmalzer said she and her husband had been friends with Joseph Potter for 20 years, and he confided in them a week before Wyatt died that his wife had been drinking excessively since she had the baby.

Hey, Joe: First, I think a second year in Dick Jauron's system will have a positive effect on the run defense. Players should be more disciplined in staying in their gaps. Second, a linebacker with speed should be added and the safety position has to be reassessed.
Depending on whom you ask, some 200 to 400 of Eureka Springs' 2,000 residents are working artists. To be sure, some of them are awful. We saw plenty of starving-artist landscapes and kitschy knick-knacks. But we also met talented jewelers, painters, a fashion designer and a gifted woodworker who carves exquisite bowls from infested trees. Together with the city's Southern architecture, New Orleans vibe and good restaurants, Eureka Springs made a perfect home base for our weekend arty Arkansas adventure.

Each caucus is run like a mini-convention, with participants electing a chairman and voting on rules, which determine if delegates are selected individually or in a slate, if they are bound to a particular candidate, or if they move forward uncommitted.
On Thursday afternoon, a few children congregated in the fine weather as workers put finishing touches on the structure at 4415 Northfield Road. Librarians invited the kids inside for an impromptu preview, Strobel said.

Comment: Much, much more than anyone could have dreamed.
A study by the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority found that the Cumberland Mall leg of the Cobb line could take until 2026.
The program is designed to cope with rising student demand as state funds dwindle. The move has raised questions about whether it would create two tiers of students in a system designed to make education accessible to everyone.
The No. 2 receiver job is wide open, and the Jets could look to the draft to find their guy. The team is financially invested in top receiver Santonio Holmes, and Jeremy Kerley, a fifth-round pick last year, showed promise as a slot receiver last year. But a young, tall, fast receiver to pair opposite Holmes could be a difference-maker, even in a run-first offense. If Notre Dame’s Michael Floyd lasts until the 16th pick, he could be a great option. But senior personnel consultant Terry Bradway also expects receiver talent late in the draft, and the Jets have shown interest in a handful of guys (Georgia Tech’s Stephen Hill, Wake Forest’s Chris Givens, Northwestern’s Jeremy Ebert) who could be available later.
With 60 days to go before the Democratic-controlled Legislature traditionally recesses for the summer, the Republican governor will begin pressing for votes on the tax cut and other initiatives he outlined in his State-of-the-State speech.
Peter Swire, an Ohio State professor, said using a software "kill switch" is legal because companies can protect themselves from fraud and other crimes.
A breakdown in talks would be an opportune time to send we-mean-business signals to Iran. Obama might take up the Senate GOP leadership's offer to help write a resolution authorizing military action. He might order pouring more oil into the strategic reserve to cushion the economy from the fallout of hostilities. He might propose a 1 percent income surtax to be levied in the event of war to pay its costs. No doubt there are people in the administration with other or better ideas.
Each district is hosted by the highest seed of the four teams. The winner of each district qualifies for the double-elimination state tournament.
NOTE: If you'd like to make your own liqueur, soak 1 cup of food-safe flowers (such as honeysuckle, violets, roses and elderflowers) or 1/2 cup lavender petals in one 750-ml bottle of vodka or neutral-grain alcohol. Let it sit for 7 to 10 days, then strain. Add up to 1/2 cup sugar (to taste); stir until dissolved. For a nonalcoholic version, simmer lavender petals in a simple syrup (see recipe for L'Enfant Lemonade).
All but one of the men charged in New Jersey with stolen property conspiracy and other counts lives in Florida.
Missouri took over the St. Louis schools in 2007 and is still running them with little success. The state created an awkward situation in which an appointed special administrative board governs the schools and local voters continue to elect a school board whose members are as impotent as a stable of geldings.
It's my opinion that the public doesn't have the right to hear tapes of 9-1-1 calls, unless approval is first given by the caller or the victim, or is required to be released by authorities in the interest of public safety, or surfaces in a court of law.

Just about every year St. Francis Prep is considered one of the favorites to win the CHSAA Class AA intersectional title. Yet the Terriers have struggled in big games. Until this year. Purificato had the league’s best team, but also pressed all the right buttons and put his players in the best position to succeed.

An Avondale man has turned himself in after being accused of kidnapped his wife while she drove to obtain an order of protection, police said.
That is why, in what is a truly pathetic example of political opportunism, McIntosh's campaign dug through every grant the Women's Fund has given out over the years. Think about that: Brooks has volunteered her time and effort to the local nonprofit group that tries to improve and save lives, and McIntosh's campaign saw that as an opportunity to go after her -- even if it meant politicizing an organization that seeks to do nothing more than good work. In politics circa 2012, is nothing off-limits?

In the early 20th century, Ushuaia was a Siberia-like outpost, and Argentina built a notorious prison compound here, with convicts put to work building roads and other infrastructure.

In 1989, Kroll resigned from his job to serve as a mitigation expert for Harris. Scouring Harris' history, Kroll was tasked with discovering clues that might signal to an appeals court that Harris deserved life in prison, not death by poison gas.

If they cut 28,000 positions from the Postal Service, I hope about half of them are the people that are up in the penthouse. We need our letter carriers; we don't need the bosses. The bosses just sit at a desk and make stupid decisions. It's the men and women who are out there in the snow, in the heat, delivering mail. And in case you're wondering, no, I'm not a letter carrier and neither is anyone in my family. But I do appreciate the person that brings my mail to me.

Asked whether she's a stealth Republican, Stoppa told the Chicago Sun-Times that she is a "moderate Democrat" who voted in Democratic primaries in earlier years.

There were so many things that were great about playing football at Maryland. A lot of people would assume that getting to play in a big stadium and play on TV was cool, and that was cool. But I think the biggest thing was every day, walking into that locker room and having the camaraderie and the brotherhood around you, knowing 100 guys were going out and putting the same uniform on and working toward a goal and representing the state of Maryland. I’m from Pennsylvania, but it was my dream to play football at Maryland since fifth grade. Every day of the last five years, I remembered that. I remember telling my dad that I was going to play there and him just kind of shrugging it off. Knowing that I was living my dream from age 18 to 22, it was a dream come true. The best part of it was being able to put that jersey and helmet on every day.
From Billboard: Blunderbuss' has elements of nearly every project he's worked on  even some of the 1950s bounce of the White-produced Wanda Jackson album on I'm Shakin' ' and Trash Tongue'  but also shows sides that the self-imposed, regimented simplicity of the White Stripes didn't allow. There are softer piano-driven songs (Love Interruption') and, at the opposite extreme, filthy guitar raunch (16 Saltines'), but also elaborate tracks reminiscent of late-'60s psychedelia, like the Zombies or Small Faces. Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy' in particular is unlike anything White's ever done, with a complex, hop-scotching melody and rhythm; similarly, I Guess I Should Go to Sleep' has a soaring vocal, a jazzy tempo and a violin solo. With a sound that's vintage and organic but also very clean, the album is so diverse that virtually every song comes as a surprise.

Twain was a walking contradiction, a grade-school dropout from Hannibal with a deep knowledge of history and human nature.

Some are concerned that OCN represents an advocacy site and not a news service. Oregonian Editor Peter Bhatia wrote on Sunday that we have vetted their coverage. OCN is clearly a news model that we haven’t seen before here in Oregon. It seems only fitting that a project like ONN should take a close look at it. Ultimately, their reporting will have to speak for itself.

It might be tempting to characterize "Che" as a rebuttal to the more conventional storytelling and humanist exuberance of 2004's "The Motorcycle Diaries," from director Walter Salles. But they're not at odds. Soderbergh has expressed his admiration for that film, and Del Toro effortlessly suggests Guevara's formative adventures as a bourgeois rebel. The political realities of his legacy can be endlessly debated, but in this flawed work of austere beauty, the logistics of war and the language of revolution give way to something greater, a struggle that may be defined by politics but can't be contained by it.

"Feast of Love" is slim pickings, even though it was adapted from a respected novel by Charles Baxter -- why do I smell a potboiler behind the admiring book reviews? -- was directed by Robert Newman and stars Morgan Freeman, Jane Alexander and Greg Kinnear. The promise of the screen version, set in an Oregon town where everyone knows everyone else's business, is a celebration of love in many forms, enlivened by the celebrants' foibles. What passes for the movie's reality is interlocking episodes of ersatz ecstasy and angst -- a Cupid-governed "Crash" -- plus snippets of wisdom dispensed by Mr. Freeman's character, who serves as the town's coffee-shop philosopher. At one point he tells a love-struck friend, "I think I'd proceed with caution." I'd proceed just as cautiously to the movie.

EAST HARTFORD, Conn. — The game itself was one of those soul-crushing defeats you wouldn’t wish on your worst enemy, so that — by default — becomes the lasting memory of 2011.

In "Prague Winter," her compelling new memoir, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright emphasizes the importance of leadership -- or its lack -- in world affairs. As a woman, she is the Czechoslovakian-born daughter of Josef Korbel and Anna Spiegelova. As a diplomat, she is a daughter of Munich, the infamous agreement that turned part of her country over to Nazi Germany. She rebuts Tolstoy, "who argued that scholars routinely exaggerate the ability of the great and powerful to control events," by citing the weak and vacillating leaders who failed to recognize evil and stand up to Hitler. They were accessories before the fact, changing history by inaction.

However, of the following recipes, Vanilla Bean Crepes with Apple-Date Butter and Cheese Blintzes can be made almost completely in advance. It's also possible to prepare the batter and fillings for both the Savory Mushroom Crepes and the Moon Crepes ahead, although the actual crepes are better made to order. But making crepes one by one, as the batter sputters in the pan and sends out buttery aromas, is a great excuse to have people over.

Mr. Blackwell of Arkansas uses different iconic Southern fixtures as his models, but his homes stand out starkly from their neighbors. His $450,000 Keenan Tower House, the "trailer on a stick," is 80 feet tall and very narrow. It starts out as wood, to relate to surrounding trees, and then turns into white metal at the top as a nod to the clouds in the sky. Mr. Blackwell says his work isn't so foreign that locals can't relate to it. "They see it and think it looks strangely familiar," he says.

Manson speaks often of Echols, vilified in his community in part for his taste for heavy metal and black T-shirts. They finally met just days ago, and the rocker felt an immediate, genuine connection. "He thinks I've been through worse than him," Manson says.

The takeaway: The Rams topped Drexel, 59-56, Monday in the CAA title game, ending the Dragons' 19-game winning streak.

Israel, for example, could announce that it would be willing to return the entire Golan Heights — providing Israel's security and water concerns were taken into consideration — to a Syrian regime that was genuinely democratic, if that regime signed a peace treaty with Israel incorporating trade, tourism and diplomatic relations. (As former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir once said, "I will know that there is a real peace with Syria when I can go shopping in Damascus.") To be sure, many Israelis, remembering Syrian forces firing down on the Galilee from the Golan Heights before the 1967 war, would be loathe to give up the Golan. Nonetheless, the security benefits to Israel of a Syria that has broken its ties with Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas would be well worth the return of the Golan.

When we talk about the potential risk for overlay, entrapment and suffocation, it's a little more clear-cut. Parents can't always be awake and can't always be watching their baby. Babies have very compressible chests when they're little, as well as tiny little heads and tiny noses and tiny mouths. If these get covered, it's very dangerous.
Before this game, pitching coach Dave Eiland asked Luis Mendoza what had changed since spring training. Luis pitched as well or better than anyone in Surprise, but has pitched poorly since breaking camp. Luis said he thought he had to be better to compete during a big league season. The result has been being too fine  trying to make perfect pitches on the corners. Dave Eiland told Luis to trust his stuff, pound the zone with low strikes and let hitters get themselves out.

Now we're on North Albina Street, for another "Portlandia" signature -- a customer who can't get service. A guy calls the DMV about getting a replacement title, and days pass as he waits on the phone, while DMV workers (Brownstein and Armisen) noodle around on instruments. Finally, the guy gets a letter in the mail -- not helping him with his request, but including a CD by the DMV workers. Having fun at the expense of long DMV waits is certainly universal, and a time-honored comedy tradition, but it doesn't seem particularly unique to the "Portlandia" world.

I would not change my advice for the teacher last week, but I have a bit of advice for those who agree with the tone and tenor of your comments.

Advocate for your positions outside of the classroom. Believe what you will, but today, serve and teach who is before you, all of them.
The idea of a gender-based pay gap had never occurred to Stephanie Eaton, 45, of Randallstown, an out-of-work certified medical coder. In her last full-time job, she earned about $52,000 and never thought to ask how that compared with her male counterparts' salaries.

I was wrong. From the start, "Shortbus" made me glad for the wait -- and of course, glad for the "command" to see it. Mistress Morgana and I agreed that it was the best portrayal and contextualization of hard-core sex -- real sex -- that we'd seen yet in a film. The movie opens with a medley of the main characters having explicit sex, from autofellatio to intercourse in many amazing positions. And in each case it's realistic to a fault, without telling the viewer what to think about the sex they're seeing. Fluids fly, women seek orgasm openly for its own sake and nothing else.

Your 17-year-old boy is not only still a minor, but also does not have the financial and institutional standing to support himself. Instead, he lives at home, becoming an adult incrementally on his parents' dime. It makes no sense for parents to absorb the money and decision-making burdens of adulthood while just handing their kids the perks. If Junior wants to play house, then he can rent house. If he doesn't like the back seat, then he can be abstinent.

The biggest difference between American Idol and The X Factor is performance night. This night will air on Wednesdays, once the live shows get going. If you’ve watched American Idol, you know it’s typically the singer with a band and backing vocalists. In The X Factor, it’s the whole shebang. There’s choreography, costuming, dancers, bands, props, et cetera. Each night is truly filled with performances to show off why each contestant either has the X Factor or doesn’t. There’s no denying a well-rounded live performance makes or breaks the song. True, sometimes all you need is a microphone and a spotlight. However, other times, you really need some pyrotechnics. You know, just to heat things up.
At Bayer’s suggestion, Herndon called in Stephen Saltzburg, a George Washington University law professor, to serve as a mediator.

Bucking bales 11 hours a day at a ranch near Soledad, they share quarters with the cowboy Slim (a deft turn by Chad Deverman), the callous Carlson (Michael Ray Wisely) and the kindly old Candy (Gary Martinez), who lost a hand working on the farm and got $250 in compensation. The ranch hands have been hardened by their way of life, but still try to eke out a few moments' pleasure. They play cards, tell tall tales and gawk at the boss's daughter-in-law (Lena Hart) -- the only unnamed character in the story -- while avoiding her hotheaded husband, Curley (Harold Pierce).

"The new regulations that are coming down are quite burdensome, honestly," Lochmann said.

But that doesn’t spoil what is a lovely film, all extreme close-ups of chimps grooming, eating (with their mouths open), working out which rocks or sticks are good for cracking nuts and which aren’t. Watching the chimps hunt tiny monkeys (nothing remotely graphic is shown) for food is a lesson in role-playing, teamwork and elementary tactics. We see them build their intricate “sleeping platforms” at night, wash their food and pass down knowledge from parents to children. The detail presented here is amazing.

Architecture: More than 5,000 colonial buildings grace the city with a fantasy of Baroque towers, Moorish domes, kaleidoscopic tiles and plateresque facades. On the main plaza, the Metropolitan Cathedral of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception — better known as Puebla Cathedral — built in 1575, boasts Mexico's tallest church towers and is a veritable architectural encyclopedia, with 14 chapels of various styles. Another masterpiece, the Biblioteca Palafoxiana, was built in 1646 for the pontifical seminary and is believed to be the first public library in the Americas. In fact, religion inspired much of Puebla's (and Mexico's) most impressive architecture. One of the most beautiful is the lacy white Templo de la Compañía de Jesus, built by the Jesuits in the 16th century.

Jason Cole, Yahoo! Sports: "(Ryan) Tannehill is a project. It may be three years before the team really knows what he is. He may not play much, if at all, as a rookie. While some fans hear that analysis and recoil in a Pavlovian fear created by years of watching the 17 quarterbacks go under center for the Dolphins since (Dan) Marino retired (say the name A.J. Feeley to a Dolphins fan and watch that person go into the fetal position), those same fans need to understand reality. If you want to solve the quarterback position, you have to invest in it. Whether it's money or draft picks or whatever, quarterbacks aren't found at the Dollar Store. You can bring up Tom Brady as a sixth-round pick all you want to, but the counter is Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Ben Roethlisberger and Aaron Rodgers.

These three points are why so many people throughout the world disagree with Mr. Telhami's claim that a nuclear armed Iran is a "manageable" challenge and one that Israel "may be able to live with."

It makes no sense, except in one place in the world, the place where it started, on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming.

There are kids, marriages, jobs, nights of drinking, heterosexual flings, in-laws and holidays to celebrate, and they do everything they're expected to do, but numb. Then every so often, they meet back up on the mountain and get to be themselves for a few stolen days. The situation carries a lot of emotional power, largely because it's so specific and yet undefined. The two guys -- cowboys -- are in love with each other, but we don't ever quite know if they're in love with each other because they're gay, or if they're gay because they're in love with each other.

However, OPEC members are not all equals in terms of production and population. Countries such as Nigeria cannot cut production because they have an immediate need for cash.

øThe fact is, while there is indeed some limited grant money available to business, it is not for individuals, not for startups, and also is very difficult to get. As the Grants.gov website says, "We have all seen them; late night infomercials, websites, and reference guides, advertising 'millions in free money.' Don't believe the hype! Although there are many grants on Grants.gov, few of them are available to individuals and none of them are available for personal financial assistance."

Your recent Watchdog report indicates Palomar Pomerado Health spent over $100,000 for employee parties. Palomar spokesman Leonel Sanchez apparently sniffed at the number and said, "We generate $1.8 billion in gross revenues" and only "A small percentage (1.5%) of our revenues come from taxpayers." Well, Mr. Sanchez, those figures mean that the taxpayers give you $27 million per year (1.5%x$1.8 billion). That is nothing to sniff at. While you say you "heal" people, and you "feed" people, you certainly don't do so for free. I suggest you consider ending your practice of spending significant sums of taxpayer money for free parties for your personnel.

A gas tax increase won't be the only transportation revenue measure on the table this January. The panel is also expected to propose raising vehicle registration fees by 50 percent and doubling vehicle emission testing charges. Why these fees are considered less controversial is a wonder.

The apparent deadline to begin organizing a new race is March. I hope it passes without having been met relieving the taxpayers of another burden about which they weren't even consulted.

Even better, because the massaged greens have such a wonderful texture and just the right mix of sweet and bitter flavor, you don't need much of a salad dressing. Use a little good olive oil and a pinch of salt when you're giving it a rubdown, and all you need afterward is a hint of acidity -- vinegar or lemon juice -- to make a perfectly balanced salad.

If possible, switch fluorescent lighting with flourescents that provide full spectrum light such as Vita-Lite & Vita Brite Full Spectrum Lighting. High-hats (down lighting) or other overhead lighting that provides warmer colored light is another alternative. If replacing fluorescents is impossible, try replacing the cool white bulbs with pink ones. It will not reduce stress levels associated with X-rays or flickers, but it may provide a warmer, more natural light source.

The Church at Pierce Creek case is not even analogous to the Pulpit Initiative. The Pulpit Initiative is not about churches running full-page political ads in newspapers. Indeed, in that case, the church never asserted that placing the ad was part of its free exercise of religion. In contrast, a pastor speaking from the pulpit to his congregation is the "core" of the free exercise of religion. As you must know, no federal court has ever been confronted with a constitutional challenge to the government's restriction on what a pastor says from the pulpit. The point of the Pulpit Initiative is to create a legal precedent that restores the right of pastors to speak freely from the pulpit without government censorship or control.

ø"It's been a frustrating year, and I'm trying to have a good attitude about it, but it gets tougher and tougher every day. My body has been fine for a long time, but it's been one little thing after another," Kim said. "I hit it better (today) than I've hit it in a long time. To come out here and hit the ball in the middle of the face over and over felt pretty good. I haven't had the opportunity to practice and get better. It's not so much the injuries, but the confidence I get from practicing is what I can't get.
øContinuing his remarkable comeback from a broken neck suffered last August when he was hit in the head by a line drive against Washington, Nicasio (2-0) gave up two runs and nine hits. He struck out four and walked two in helping the Rockies cool off the streaking Dodgers, who were coming off a series sweep of the Nationals. Los Angeles owns the best record in the NL at 16-7.

Many of the businesses that the government marks as failures have simply been left behind because the people behind them have found other jobs. Or they've been put on a back burner while another idea is pursued.
Now consider life with our children. We never get the ones we so looked forward to, either. Those perfect little always-delightful things who respond to us sweetly and love us perfectly into our old age. We get the children who present challenges, and difficulties, and outright sin to be dealt with in ways we never thought possible, but who give us joy and enrich us in ways we never conceived of, either. Not least of all because suddenly it's not "all about me" anymore.
"I don't know my friends very well, I haven't seen them since 2009," admitted Kylend. "I have flown home to see my family and done things I have had to do. I don't have time to see anybody. My only real friends are here on the tour."

The NFL knows a painful day is coming. With help from places such as the Boston University center, and more education, we're learning more about the effects of concussions and brain damage. We're learning frightening things and the league has publicly acknowledged the link itself, and taken some measures to help try to protect its current players. But a court someday is going to put a number on the neglect the league demonstrated for years.
While tropical storms are somewhat common in New Jersey, only two hurricanes have ever made landfall here — one in 1903 and another in 1821. While that makes this a dangerous situation in and of itself, New Jersey has other factors working against it.

"There would be three key benefits to the people of Washington State should we re-elect you to Congress. The first and most obvious is that you would return to Congress with 16 years of seniority as the leading Democrat on the House Labor and Education Committee and also the leading Democrat on the Government Oversight Committee. You have done a terrific job on both committees in exposing corporate corruption and protecting the rights of the people. None of the other Democratic candidates running in the open Congressional Districts here in Washington State have any experience in Congress and would have no seniority on any committee in Congress. In fact, none of the current Democratic candidates running in our three open Congressional Districts have ever won a Congressional race and many of them have never won any race for anything at any point in their careers. Given the huge problems facing our nation right now, this is no time to be sending a rookie to Congress.

Test yourself: Sit quietly for five minutes. Use your fingertips to find a pulse at your wrist or throat. Count the number of beats in 30 seconds and multiply by two. If your rate is above 75, consider talking to a medical caregiver about whether you need to make changes to lower your heart attack risk. You might want to do so if your resting rate is above 60.
-- Some resorts or hotels base their "regular" rate claim on their high-season price, even when the sale price is limited to off-season visits. That well may be the case in my example: The high-season price for a junior suite at the Caribbean property involved (in mid-February) is actually $306 per night. But November is the middle of the slowest quarter of the year for all Caribbean destinations, and just about everybody there is pushing very low off-season rates.

But that peace risked being strained by the repeated delays in the trial for the two brothers, Avi and Eliyahu Werdesheim. The alleged assault took place in November 2010. The Werdesheims were indicted in January 2011. They pleaded not guilty in February of that year. And since then, their attorneys have requested and been granted six postponements of the trial for assorted reasons — the absence of one of the brothers' lawyers, illness, or the desire for more time to investigate. This week, they asked for a delay until the passions stirred by the fatal shooting of Florida teen Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman cool, and a change of venue to a location where the Martin case would be less likely to influence jurors. That was a step too far. Fortunately, the attorneys reconsidered and requested a bench trial instead. Persisting in their effort might have served only to create new tensions where few now exist.

Evidence of this is the initial goal of $2,000 they had to get to SXSW. In all, $2,700 was raised — and that was quite fortuitous, because Putka’s car broke down before SXSW and the group had to rent a car to get down to Austin. The extra $700 helped make that possible.

Buffalo receiver Steve Johnson apologized for a touchdown celebration against the Jets in which he pretended to shoot himself in the leg, a la Jets receiver Plaxico Burress in a New York nightclub a few years back.

But a plan won't prevent another major flood from occurring or protect people whose lives would be at risk if it did. Only repairs to the levees can do that. Parts of the Metro East flood-control system date back to the 1930s. River water is seeping underneath the levees. Old pumps and drainage tiles must be replaced. Making those repairs could cost as much as $180 million. But 65 percent of the cost eventually could be recovered if Congress appropriates funds to pay for the work - as it should.

As for the suggestion that BackBid could turn the hotel industry hypercompetitive, I have only one thing to say to that: Now hotels know how it must have felt when Priceline burst onto the scene and consumers had to guess the winning rate when they made a "name your own price" bid. Many guests complained to me afterward, believing that they had overpaid. Hotels didn't care. Now they're getting their comeuppance, some might argue.

I was eager to try the specialty olive stuffed naan ($4.95), a standout if you love green olives (or martinis). Owner Arun Puri said his wife developed the recipe a few years ago after watching her husband sip a martini. I loved the warm bits of chopped olives layered in the thin wheat bread. It tasted so fresh and wholesome but also bold with the salty olives. Normally, I like to dip the bread in sauces and dishes, but with this naan I wanted to savor every bite without embellishment. The kitchen also prepares an onion basil naan and naan stuffed with lamb or chicken.

The dismissal comes three days before Dior is set to unveil Mr. Galliano's fall-winter 2011/2012 collection before the world's fashion critics and retail buyers at Paris Fashion Week. But the severity of the designer's remarks meant Dior had to act, says a person close to the company.
County Council approved the same policy at its first meeting Monday evening. Later, members will consider a new, stricter ethics policy written by a transition committee.
To some Americans, this agenda will seem ambitious. To others, it may seem frightening. But House leaders believe their main risk is appearing too timid to their own members. Even if this three-part strategy proceeds with efficiency and success, in two years it will result in a budget freeze, an unsuccessful guerrilla campaign against health reform and the bare beginnings of the entitlement debate. Will Tea Party revolutionaries view this as victory? Will they be tempted by the Ross Perot option -- a third-party movement that would increase the odds of Obama's re-election?
Republicans said they want Obama to change more than his rhetoric. They complain that a $787 billion economic stimulus package enacted last year did not do enough to increase employment. And they oppose Obama's plan to let income tax cuts expire next year for families making more than $250,000 a year.
She says she may need to find another way to generate cash in the future if her classes and other sources of revenue don't grow over the next two years. But she has no plans to stop selling raw milk.

Sightlines in the stadium and proximity to the field will be a priority. One of the Metrodome's endearing qualities is the noise level that the fans generate, ear-splitting volume that gives the Vikings one of the better home-field advantages in the league. The Wilfs want to recreate that atmosphere as much as possible.
With a young tree like yours, it should be deeply watered approximately every two weeks during the dry season. The frequency will depend on your soil type.

"That's the great unknown. What might develop down the road is a market for privately traded securities," Shirodkar says. If so, he adds, investors don't have to buy just publicly traded stock.
Golden Mayor Marjorie Sloan sees it differently, saying negotiations over the Jefferson Parkway ended in December after "it became apparent that the parties could not reach an agreement." She said the draft beltway bill hasn't helped engender trust between the parties since.

She said the group has not determined how it will raise money for the addition.
The newspaper found the agency — which treats the sewage of more than 1.3 million people in Essex, Bergen, Passaic and Hudson counties — was being used by its commissioners as a private piggy bank, hiring wives, brothers, in-laws and children; approving special-interest contracts; and hiring of politically connected officials at six-figure salaries.
But Spoden noted that assessing a drought is largely subjective, with difficult-to-pinpoint origins and varying effects. Had the recent dry spell occurred during a growing season, he said, it "would have been mentioned among the great droughts in history." Instead, because much of it happened during winter, local governments were pleased by how much money they weren't spending on snow removal.
The St. Louis Public Schools will have to cleave another $18 million off this year's $300 million budget, cuts that will come from several departments, but most heavily from central office staff, leaders said Thursday.

Their relationship has been through some rough patches. There have been "infidelities." The first being a brown monkey named Mandela. Mandela was a world traveler, having gone with us when we visited the Dominican Republic when Big Bits was only 5 months old. The little monkey was hugged as we took off from St. Louis on a cold February day and sat on a shaded table as we hung out by the pool for a week, keeping a constant eye on Big Bits and even letting a little green lizard sit on his head for everyone's amusement. Mandela got his name in the Dominican, as one of the pool girls thought it was sad that we were calling our child's favorite toy Monkey (we aren't that imaginative when it comes to naming toys either it seems).

Individuals generally are not eligible for Medicare until age 65 so if Shawn was to retire this year, they would have to consider alternatives for health insurance.
I'm disappointed with the soup at many places, but here the combinations are so enticing I had to order it on each visit. The first time it was cream of asparagus teetering on the edge of rosemary overload; the second was sausage and farro with a rich tomato broth that was good but could have been absolutely lyrical with a little more restraint with the herbs. On my third visit, the soup was an exceptional black bean ($7) that took on the meaty character of the accompanying bits of chorizo with a swirl of chile cream and scallions in the center to smooth it all out.
After an apprenticeship at La Casita Mexicana in Bell, she brought her moles to Moles La Tia, in the Maravilla neighborhood of East Los Angeles, and then to La Huasteca, the swank Mexican restaurant in the Plaza Mexico in Lynwood, where she introduced the concept of rotating menus devoted to a single Mexican region before going solo with Rocio's Mole de los Dioses in Bell and, since January, in Sun Valley. Her ink-black Oaxacan mole even won a citywide mole contest a couple of years ago, its rough, sunny complexity edging out Guelaguetza and Tlapazola Grill.
By season's end, that confidence was nearly tapped out. Five months later, things have changed tenfold.

Some residents, encouraged by roadside signs boasting earnings of $10,000 a day for home rentals, are hoping to make a small fortune. Cardamone says he's read too many horror stories online from Super Bowl home renters -- who lost money to untrustworthy agencies -- to take that route.
No one is trying to get out of paying a bill, here. It's just that you want to make sure you're paying your bill, not someone else's. I asked National about your case, and a representative contacted you, and said proper procedures hadn't been followed in your case. They dropped their claim against you.

It is August 2006.
Juanita, a retired parochial school teacher with a magic touch at the slots, loved to regale me with tales of her exploits at Valley View Casino. I had never been there, so when my husband, Lou, suggested we take a quick trip to Las Vegas, I proposed an overnighter to check out Valley View's new hotel instead.

The Economic Development Action Plan suggests that Beachwood take a lead role in rallying communities along the I-271 corridor to work together to target attractive industries. That's just one of several strategies with the flavor of regionalism.
Like many playwrights, Williams had such strong ideas about how his plays should be mounted that he included specific suggestions in his scripts. But he also knew that in the end, directors and designers would make those decisions.
You pass gas about 14 times a day. We all do. Even Dr. Oz does -- not good on the set of the show! (Dr. Mike is writing this column.) Fortunately, most go unnoticed. Otherwise, a four-hour conference with 10 people would deliver 24 wind-breakers. Meeting adjourned!

"The best way is continue learning," he said. "As you learn, stop trying different things. You've got to become your own best coach. You learn from failing. It's not how hard you throw or how good your stuff is. You have to work with what you have. You have to battle. Yes, I have my own style. I have to work with it. I have to trust it."
He had also fallen behind on child support payments. Birth certificates and other public records indicate that in addition to the two children he had with his wife, Murray had fathered at least four children with three other women.
Place reserved peels and cores in a cheesecloth and tie the ends with twine. Add to the pot with simple syrup and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a low simmer and cook until the liquid becomes light red in color, about 45-50 minutes. Discard the cheesecloth pouch. Strain syrup though a fine-mesh sieve or clean cheesecloth.

Stover, who retired after spending 10 games last season with the Colts, has memories of all three Super Bowls, but the one that stands out was the 2000 season and the run the Ravens made that culminated with their one-sided victory over the Giants in the Super Bowl in January 2001 in Tampa.
American Airlines, which operates out of the heavily hit main terminal, said four of its planes were damaged, two of them significantly.

Mark Liberman is intense, dynamic, refined, whimsical and constantly striving for originality, that most elusive quality that has tortured every chef who ever aspired to take cooking to new heights.
In fact, the entire concept of brunch with scrambled eggs and pancakes and maple syrup is a bit foreign to Schwertner. As a kid, brunch was a savory affair. On Sundays after church, she'd come home to hot soup with marrow bones, or cabbage stuffed with pork.

The earlier letter authored by Rep. Tim Ryan of Niles and signed by the rest of Ohio's House of Representatives Democrats contended that the state was using tax dollars to "advance a privatization plan that could potentially severely cost drivers via increased tolls, threaten the job security of over 1,000 Ohioans, and drive up the costs for local governments through increased maintenance costs of local roads."
In addition to a title defense, the Cardinals embark on a generational shift. Matheny, 41, is the youngest manager in either league. Six years removed from his last season as a player, the Cardinals manager is 11 months younger than last season's lefthanded relief specialist, Arthur Rhodes.
This week, Cohen does have to get around to ordering more Tressel bobbleheads. They sold out around Christmas, and his plan prior to Monday was to wait for football season to order more. But people are asking for them now.

Photographer Kristen Vaughn was there to capture all the happy couples and their friends for The Times of Trenton. Check out the photo gallery here on NJ.com.
That's the next thing. We will never sell or have an IPO. What that does is suddenly flushes you with cash. It makes you now work for a group of stockholders, who, again, put pressure and temptations on your true-blueness. They're people who have said, "You need to turn this into a franchise." And I don't want any of that. The fourth one is we don't want employees. We only want autonomous collaborators that are incentivized to make or break their own income. To be the Frank Perdue of pastured poultry: That never interested me. I want thousands of us scattered all over the country.
These fresh-from-the-garden cocktails pair with food naturally, melding the flavors of herbs or veggies with alcohol. It sets up an easy transition into a meal and makes the drinks well suited to accompany a menu.
“He is priceless. He’s just matchless in terms of the combination of goodness of character, greatness of skill and his commitment to his university and his teammates,” Starr said. “The nation has found Robert to be this very endearing and, as someone said, he’s the most interesting person in perhaps all of athletics, but interesting in a positive sense. It’s all good, and there’s a goodness of character that makes Baylor proud.”
"People want more of a higher-energy restaurant with shared plates and a price point that allows them to go more often. Our hope is to get new customers and have them dine more frequently and not just on special occasions."

Not even Tim Tebow can clean up Meyer's fraudulent image anymore. Remember when Meyer came to Florida and preached discipline and bragged about how he only recruited players whose character ranked in "the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent."

Throughout the book, Kirshenbaum asserts that the best science experiment is the kind that defies your expectations. And so it is with the kiss itself. To best illustrate this point the book is divided into three parts. The first explores the origin of kissing, the second digs into how it affects you physiologically and the third finds the writer in an NYU laboratory trying to make new discoveries about kissing.

Slim can trace his family tree to England - 'The Prestons were silversmiths; I was hopin' they were stagecoach robbers or something' - but he can't trace his wit or his urge to gamble. 'I don't have any i-dea. No i-dea,' he says in his nasal Southern drawl. Sometimes he sounds like the fastest whine in the West. His father, a businessman, 'was dead serious. He didn't gamble. He used to kick my butt out of all the pool halls and tell the operators he was going to get them closed down if they kept letting me play.'
It can be a daunting prospect to determine what really is great to serve at a party or give as a gift. So, b asked three well-regarded wine aficionados to give their take on the best that is out there on the market, with prices for all budgets.

I am ready to celebrate, and I propose a pedestrian walk-through of the tunnels before they open to vehicular traffic. What say you, Caltrans? Do we have to beg, "Mother, may I?" See you at the grand opening. Wear your walking shoes.

"We wanted to win (the state title). Just making it to the state championship is an accomplishment itself. I thought we had a really great season."
Oh, sweet peaches, Colton just referred to Leif as a Munchkin. I’m liking him less and less. Now he’s confronting Leif about his conversation with Bill, and now he’s just called him an Oompa Loompa. You would think, being a member of a minority that gets called some pretty vile names, he would ease up on the derogatory terms for little people. People show their true colors when they feel secure in this game, and, wow, Colton’s true colors are nasty.
More than 100 passengers were taken off packed US Airways Flight 1070 after what airport officials called a security concern raised by the airline.

“Clearly, we're seeing some moderation in the economy,” Culp said. “We all read the headlines. It certainly is prudent at any time in the (business) cycle. But I think our view is, particularly so right now given the uncertainties around 2012, better to be prepared and ready for what may come than to postpone what we think is a very prudent action here.”

With all the past raiding by the state government on the transportation trust fund to shore up Maryland's budget shortfalls, without detailing exactly what projects are in an emergency need to be fixed now, and why there is not enough money or why we can't put on hold the less important projects, I see no reason to raise the gas tax.

Our deep admiration for the honeybee and sympathy for its mysterious plight gave us an idea for a great spring brunch. In the spirit of spring fever, we recommend a kitchen challenge: guests create dishes using the secret ingredient of local honey, from such L.A.-based suppliers as Kirk's Local Honey and Feral Honey & Bee. Now is when healthy bees are busy foraging new wildflowers and budding blossoms to make the sweetest, spiciest honey of the year. As part of the growing urban farming movement, it's possible to find honey crafted from the flowers in your very own town or neighborhood. With each guest as chef, taster and community supporter, brunch becomes a culinary arena. But finally the proof is in the honey itself. A symbolic tribute to the very essence of spring will call forth the Iron Chef in every cook.

Steamed clams ($13), along with some great fries, could also be enough to satisfy a hearty appetite. The clams are piled into a covered bowl with coins of fingerlings, chard and chunks of chorizo in a rich chowder-like cream sauce.

The company said today it filed for approval of Xarelto as a treatment for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and as a preventative treatment for recurring venous thromboembolism.

For now, I'm going with the Seidel Diet: Keep exercising, cut out the beer, cut out the potato chips, cut out the snacks. I had a salad for lunch, significantly reduced my portion for supper and I lost a half pound on the first day -- 33 1/2 more to go.
That would be a mistake -- at least this early in the careers of both rookies. Jamison's presence is benefiting the club, and specifically the two first-rounders. Despite a few dubious shooting nights -- notably 6-of-20 in the opener against Toronto -- he is the only other starter besides Irving creating his own shot. That can't be overstated. Take away Jamison, and Irving loses one of his best options as well as a player who can stretch the defense and create lanes for the penetrating point guard.
Put together, the allegations were an embarrassment for an American president on foreign soil and threatened to upend White House efforts to keep his trip focused squarely on boosting economic ties with fast-growing Latin America.

If a left tackle who is an excellent value is available at 19, I'd have no problem if the Bears selected him. I don't suspect that will be the case, however. There probably are three offensive tackles worth taking that high -- Matt Kalil of Southern Cal, Riley Reiff of Iowa and Jonathan Martin of Stanford. My hunch is all three will be off the board by the time the Bears pick, and better values will be available at other positions. The Bears' swing tackle in 2012 very well could be Chris Williams, or, if Williams wins a starting offensive tackle job, the swing tackle could be Webb. Either way, at this point it looks like Williams is moving back to tackle.
A record number of shoppers could head to stores across the country to take advantage of deals of up to 70 percent during the kickoff to the holiday shopping weekend.

It is important that you emphasize safe behavior at all times. Use current news stories as teachable moments to reinforce safe online practices. The more that a child adopts safe Internet practices as a standard behavior, the safer that child will be.

Mitt Romney is who he is, and he could take a lesson from Joe Biden in letting it all hang out, warts and all. His problem may be, though, that are aren't any warts of the sort that can enable him to connect with all those resistant Republicans out there.
"But do I please you (with the status quo), the fan who's been watching for 30 years, or do I go after and do everything I can to make that 18-to-21-year-old kid love it? Love it so much that they want to wear it. And now you get that 6-star recruit.

The Beavers scored three times – including their only two earned runs – in the bottom of the seventh.

My husband and I are social travelers; when we're on the road, you'll often find us at the bar, sharing stories with strangers.

We also liked the idea of having access to a kitchen, as we carried a cooler full of snacks and sandwiches for our budget road trip.
One finding: The "Sound Charge" shirts collected more energy with dance music than jazz or classical, says Mat Sears, a spokesman for Orange parent company Everything Everywhere.

​Many argue this is the best Italian restaurant in the city, although the last time I was here, everything seemed way over-sauced. Broccoli rabe, spiedini, linguine with white clams, chicken savoia, rigatoni pomodoro, penne arrabiate and other Italian standards in casual surroundings. Leave the menus, take home some cannoli.
During a week when Belleville native Randy Wells earned the attention of a national television audience as the starting pitcher for the Chicago Cubs on Saturday, June 4, I found almost as much interest on June 2 when the Gateway Grizzlies held Randy Wells Bobblehead night.
Actually he did it twice before, once last year, the other time in 2009. But last night’s two were huge.
In Shanksville, Pa., where United Flight 93 crashed in a field with a force so great it shook the school three miles away, the memories of 9/11 have never faded, even though textbooks there don't mention the attacks because they are about a decade old. Students at the school have marked the day by going to speeches at the crash site or hosting speakers such as former governors Ed Rendell or Tom Ridge, who held the office at the time of the attacks and became the first secretary of Homeland Security.

But law enforcement must, at all times, follow the law and act wisely and appropriately. Our respect for law enforcement cannot change the inescapable conclusion that a great deal went wrong at the Metro Gang Strike Force. Based on our experience, and as a result of our investigation, we have reached the conclusion that some of the individuals at the Metro Gang Strike Force engaged in serious misconduct, misconduct that was appalling and outrageous. Our Report condemns their actions.
So much holiday "dining advice" is negative: what we can't do, shouldn't eat, mustn't drink at all costs. The net result is that we spend our energy and attention on these Don't Wants and - of course - end up thinking of little else.
"For more than 30 years, our citizens have paid a one-penny sales tax for regional transit," Wood wrote. "They are now being asked to pay an additional penny while our neighbors are only being asked to pay one penny. Our citizens will not vote for a tax that perpetuates this inequity for another 30 years."
I'm not concerned that this indulgent anger will produce thousands of Joe Stacks; he was an extreme case. My real worry is that the garden-variety version of this anger will be so virulent and inescapable that it will so alienate other, cooler citizens that they will give up on politics altogether.
Another television ad features Scott Tipton, vice president of the Ohio Fraternal Order of Police. "We told you they would lie and that's why we'll continue to police the facts," Tipton says.
Excessive tarmac delays have been on the government's radar ever since a Northwest Airlines flight was grounded during a 1999 snowstorm at Detroit's Metro Airport, leaving passengers without water or working toilets for more than seven hours. Efforts were well under way to address the issue even before the latest gang of tarmac activists parachuted into town, and there was a consensus that the new regulations, the last of which went into effect in August, would fix whatever problem remained.
For example, on a run away from him, he can juke to make a defender think he’s getting into his route. That’s a lot simpler than having to block the guy. And when it’s a play-action fake, he can lull a defender with a similar-looking move before blowing by him.
The league also plans to clean up the game with stricter policing of reckless tackles after watching playmakers such as Seattle's Steve Zakuani and Dallas' David Ferriera suffering season-ending injuries and Real Salt Lake's Javier Morales miss more than four months of play with an injury.

"They're special. Those two guys will be really good NBA players, with their athleticism, their length, their explosiveness," Oregon coach Dana Altman said.
A strategy that focuses on how the force will exit fails to consider how military success will be translated into political success. And a focus on extricating ourselves from a conflict rather than on achieving success - also known as victory - signals to an adversary that if he ratchets up his resistance, we will exit more quickly.

Moreover, at 20-year intervals, Ohioans are asked at the ballot box if they wish to call a convention to "revise, alter or amend" the constitution. Next year -- 2012 -- will be one of those years.

“I’d like to see him wait because from my standpoint, the kids in that program that he recruited and sold, they were very excited.

It barely gave us time to take in the setting. It feels like a turn-of-the-century saloon, with well-worn wood floors, forest green bead-board wainscoting and mottled gold walls covered with dozens of old pictures, sayings and framed newspaper clippings. Five private wooden booths along one wall evoke expectations of clandestine meetings.

øWhat you're asking is a natural instinct. When you see others getting wealthy, it's completely understandable for you to want to join in and get a piece of the riches, too. Unfortunately, your plan of jumping into stocks that have already run up the most doesn't usually end well for investors. But before getting to that, I'll first provide the list of stocks you asked for.

The 2011 tear-jerker views the world through Oskar's trusting eyes, as he obsessively tries to make sense of a senseless act.
This definition is a problem for many people. They belong to a religion but they don't really believe or practice everything that the religion teaches. There may be some beliefs or practices that they don't follow. For, example, a 1998 study of Presbyterians found that only two-thirds of its members attended Sunday worship services "every week" or "nearly every week" Similarly, almost a third of its members don't agree that "Jesus will return to earth some day." Remember, this survey is among members of the church. We have earlier discussed the fact that evangelical Christians beat their wives and divorce their spouses about as often as their non-Christian neighbors do.

When the chemicals are mixed together, they form a boiling, stinky mixture of benzoquinone that the beetle can aim at any potential predator, firing pulses of the hot poison at a rate of 300 per second. "It's a revolvable gun emplacement, so the beetle can fire accurately in any direction," he later said. "And considering that they generate their own ammunition and store everything that's needed to make that ammunition, they're pretty self-contained."
A riff on Lorraine Hansberry's 1959 drama "A Raisin in the Sun," "Clybourne Park" tells its acid tale in two acts. The first act focuses on the family selling their house in Chicago's Clybourne Park house to the Younger family, who will be the first black family in the neighborhood; the neighbors try to stop the sale. Act Two picks up 50 years later, when Clybourne Park - by now a black community - is ripe for gentrification, and a white couple wants to buy the same house for themselves.
"The intent of whoever did this to cause mayhem, create casualties," Kelly said.
"The fact that they're serving as a role model is fantastic," he said. "I'm super appreciative."

His sentiment was echoed Tuesday by others in the business community, who seemed hard-pressed to find shortcomings in the proposals.

"You can see the connection here. Every time that something happens they shove it in a letter," Arpaio said.

So how does a patriotic American decide which lobby to believe? You might start by asking, Which one is more obviously trying to buffalo me? Clearly that is the Billsters (let's call them) with their ludicrous attempt to create patriotic sentiment around the dollar bill. Then you might ask, Which side has hired Frank Luntz? Once again, it's the dollar bill people.
"The response was beyond my wildest dreams," Chicago said. "Over a million people have seen it. I was not going to be happy until it found a permanent home.

The first day of playoff practice always has a little more hop to it, and not just because Zamboni-sensei Al Sobotka holds one of his traditional barbecues. The Wings may be the fifth seed to Nashviile's fourth, and they may be going up against a team that's big and physical, but they feel well-prepared because all their injured guys, save Helm, have been back long enough to feel good about themselves.
"If they saw me, they would have killed me," he said. "They could have gone around the front of the vehicle and waited for me to come up there and shot me at close-range like they did the officer."
Gov. Mark Dayton hit the nail on the head when he spoke of "prejudice against public school teachers," but to undercut education reform will only perpetuate the problem ("Teacher-tenure veto halts a top GOP priority," May 4). Students, teachers and taxpayers have been held hostage for years by outdated, protectionist union regulations that defy common sense and damage the opportunity for students to get an education by putting bad teachers ahead of good students. No wonder the public is frustrated. Unfortunately, teachers who may not even support Education Minnesota or their PAC are forced to be members and bear the brunt of the frustration that should go to the union itself and DFL legislators. For years, the teachers union, Education Minnesota, has funded DFL campaigns, and the DFL has supported the union's stranglehold on education. Students, parents and taxpayers are completely out of the loop. Teachers may have to stand up for themselves. They do deserve better, and this reform would have opened the door for building a better future for them and their students.

Outlook: The Brewers' starting pitching, strong at the top with Zack Greinke and Yovani Gallardo, fell short in the postseason last year and hasn't been improved.

Well, under questioning by Trung attorney Steve Baric, Registrar Neal Kelley said one of the steps in the "original" system of voting is that a voter with an electronic ballot must look at a printed version of his vote and confirm it is accurate before making the selection final by electronic means.

Arda: I liked what Daniel Bryan said in a recent interview about feeling this match will be very stiff. Bryan has been on fire lately with his character, and unfortunately for Sheamus, all eyes are on DBryan going into WrestleMania, despite Sheamus having won the Royal Rumble. The prevalent thought in my mind is, "how will Daniel Bryan find a sneaky, conniving way to leave WrestleMania as champion"? And that's what I'm predicting. I'm also guessing that this rivalry won't end at WrestleMania and we will see a PPV rematch with an added stipulation to account for how Daniel Bryan keeps his title at WrestleMania.

In August, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta agreed. Florida and 25 other states were suing, but they needed an individual to contest the mandate.

How does an artist who specializes in anodyne professions of puppy love stay relevant as his fan base ages along with him? Has the time come for Justin Bieber to get sexy?

"You always remember the losses more than you remember the wins," Matta said, starting to mention tiny moments from the five losses so far. "I remember year one us not blocking out at the end of the first half and they tip one in to go down three. . . . First play of the game last year, we executed to perfection and we didn't throw it where we wanted to throw it."
Each year, most California students take statewide benchmark exams called STAR tests. Depending on how they do, they are scored as advanced, proficient, basic, below basic or far below basic. The test results have big implications for schools under No Child Left Behind; parents can transfer students away from schools that consistently perform poorly.
Jake Tindle of Triad (46-1), who finished fourth last season, will square off with Nathan Jackson of Marian Catholic in the quarterfinals of 170 Friday after each won preliminary matches Thursday.

Our sports teams either squat in pathetic muck all season long or take us to the brink of glory before smashing our hopes into tiny shards of tear-shaped glass. We once cornered the airplane-building market but let it go because well, people flying in airplanes, that will never last. We let Seattle have it.

Most of the new space has a business purpose. The 7,000 square feet of space set aside for temporary exhibits every six months to a year will give locals a reason to make a return trip. Increasing the number of classrooms from two to five will help double the 100,000 kids and 9,000 teachers whose schools pay for marine science instruction annually. The meeting space will help attract more rent-paying conferences, events and weddings.
Another hurdle for electric cars is lack of public awareness. Many Americans still know very little about them, or have concerns about cost, range, safety and charging requirements.
If you decide to buy some of the more expensive "superfruit" juices, here are a few tips from dietitian Lisa Cimperman of University Hospitals Case Medical Center; food engineer Monica Giusti of Ohio State University's Department of Food Science and Technology; and Dr. Tanya Edwards, medical director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic:
Change is often called progress, but as far as I am concerned, it is not always progress.
It’s no wonder the Romney camp was bent out of shape this week.
Murans has invested in several syndicates since then and has a stake in 15 horses. Last year, he was part of the Dream Team Racing Stable, which owns a portion of Mucho Macho Man. Through that venture, he met Jerry Crawford, the head of Donegal Racing, and became an investor.

øRates aren't the only consideration. California's bond has a higher yield than most because, well, it's California. The state has budget issues, to put it mildly, which is why it's rated A1 by Moody's - a decent rating, but not the top one.
But the trend has stirred opposition. Some educational experts and union leaders say that value-added is not reliable enough for high-stakes decisions on firing, tenure or pay; that it is a narrow gauge of teaching; and that it pressures instructors to "teach to the test."

The $3.5 trillion spending plan the House budget chairman released Tuesday morning is a great deal like what Mr. Ryan and his tea-party-endorsed colleagues in the House offered last year — with a bit less detail in areas that got him and his party in so much trouble last year, like cuts in Medicare benefits for senior citizens.
Mayor Bloomberg also performed well -- asserting control, communicating concisely to the public, evacuating sick and infirm residents from hospitals and nursing homes and dishing out dire warnings (“they could die”) for able-bodied, able-minded people who didn’t heed evacuation orders. Shelters were well-marked and well-stocked, with the people who spent the night there satisfied.

Trainer Billy Meister, also the jockey of And The Eagle Flys, brought him along slowly and last week saw him take fourth place at the Grand National.
What is rare is for members to acknowledge such transgressions. The outrage over the infamous 2005 attempt by Sen. Carole Migden to cast a vote for one of her bills when it was in the Assembly was an aberration. When the violation is among members in the same house, within the same party, the pressure to close ranks is intense. At least one other Assembly Democrat privately told colleagues that he was the victim of a ghost vote against his will in the last week of May. He declined to be interviewed.

NEW YORK – Yankees manager Joe Girardi noticed the splits. Entering last night's game, Orioles left-hander Brian Matusz had allowed lefties a slash line of .154/.214/.154 while righties teed off for a .333/.424./.514. So, Girardi loaded up his lineup with right-handers, meaning the odd alignment of Chris Stewart behind the plate so Russell Martin's bat could stay in the lineup at designated hitter.

To get the bedbugs-are-coming word out, we can think of an even better strategy than surveys of pest-control companies that are then sent to the press. (Newspapers, after all, are so yesterday.)

While Ting can preach about the need to reset and redefine San Francisco politics with passion, it isn't clear that the strategy is paying off.

Rockies catcher Ramon Hernandez had a tough time at the dish Friday night. He was fine behind the plate, but reaching home was another matter. He threw a short temper tantrum in the fourth inning after being tagged out by catcher Jonathan Lucroy. Hernandez chugged home from second base on a single by pitcher Jhoulys Chacin, and appeared to avoid the tag. Home plate umpire Larry Vanover thought otherwise. In the sixth, Hernandez was tagged out trying to score from third on Chris Nelson's infield grounder.

"Bridesmaids" (Universal Studios Home Video, not rated/R, DVD $29.98; Blu-ray Disc $34.98). Raunchy and embarrassing (especially in mixed company), this gutter-mouthed comedy is also funny at times. Kristen Wiig of "Saturday Night Live" stars and co-wrote the script, which is why it has a late-night comic's dysfunctional view of relationships. The good themes about friendship and loyalty are undercut by Wiig's toxic take on female rivalry. Her character comes unhinged when her lifelong friend (Maya Rudolph) announces her engagement and brings a too-perfect new female acquaintance into the inner circle. If you like graphic depictions of what used to be called human intimacy and think nothing is funnier than explosive diarrhea, this one's for you. The new DVD includes both the theatrical cut and an unrated version with deleted footage. The cast joins director Paul Feig on a commentary track that pretty much excludes us from the fun, but it does explain why the film's setting is so jarring: Some of the exteriors were shot in Milwaukee and others in Chicago. Chi-waukee, anyone?

5. Trespassing. Reported 1:20 a.m. April 12 in the 1300 block of Lakeshore Drive. Responding to a call about a possible car break-in, officers found a subject underneath a car who admitted attempting to enter his girlfriend's vehicle so he could sleep there until she returned home.

Then again, a restaurant owned by a former butcher (Jason French) and vegetarian cafe owner (Ben Meyer) that takes the provocative anti-industrialist Ned Ludd as its icon is bound to be interesting. Especially when you throw in the challenge of wood-fired cooking.
On an annual basis, we have to deal with player availability of this nature, Hathaway said. Probably two that stand out in all of our minds from the past couple years would be Patty Mills at Saint Marys and Robbie Hummel at Purdue. Certainly, the young man youre talking about is a productive member of that team. He was averaging about 20-21 minutes a game. We will talk about his role, we will talk about the impact of his not being available to the team as they go into the postseason. That will be thoroughly vetted today in our conference reports and will thoroughly be vetted as we go through seeding conversations the remainder of the week.
Once again, Connecticut won’t start too far from home on its way to the Final Four as it takes the top seed only 59 miles away from campus. The Huskies will have extra incentive to get out of the bracket because a potential rematch with Notre Dame awaits. Remember, the Irish knocked out UConn in the same stage last year. Fourth-seeded Penn State, No. 11 in the country, could pose a tricky matchup in the Sweet 16, but UConn should make its seventh straight trip to the Elite Eight. A familiar face sits in the bottom of the bracket as Rutgers takes the No. 6 seed, but will have to face Gonzaga in Spokane, Wash. The committee did load the bracket with four of the top-12 ranked teams in the country. And don’t sleep on ninth-seeded Princeton, which despite being ranked 24 in the country, will have a tricky 8-9 game with Kansas State.
Until Thursday, Karzai had been relatively restrained in his reaction to the shootings in Panjwayi. Although he called the killings "unforgivable," he had also worked to calm public anger in Kandahar, his home province.

That's the message Adams will deliver to Multnomah County Chairman Jeff Cogen at 5:30 p.m. today in their first face-to-face meeting since tensions between the city and county surfaced publicly three weeks ago. In a stinging Sept. 14 letter, Cogen accused Adams of making "an ever changing assortment of additional demands" toward the Sellwood project that were "seemingly designed not to reach a deal but rather to drag on the negotiations indefinitely."
Not everyone is convinced of such arguments, however.

Stump removal is one type of mechanical control. If this isn't doable for some reason, another mechanical control to consider is a barrier. You could build an enclosure around and over, but not touching, the stump. You could make a platform to sit on, to serve as a low table, or as a pedestal for potted plants, depending on the shape of the stump and your preference. When the fungus has rotted away the stump, you could remove the structure, unless you end up liking it there.

James "Buck" Duke, a tobacco magnate who founded Duke University, purchased 40 farms near the Raritan River to fulfill his dream of a pastoral estate near New York City. He hired Frederick Olmsted's civil engineer, James Greenleaf, to design what was one of the earliest and most prominent examples of lagoon landscaping, with interconnecting canals and lakes providing the estate's water. Two million trees and shrubs were planted, and 35 fountains modeled after those Mr. Duke saw in Europe were installed.

Written by the team known as the Corporation (Berry Gordy, Freddie Perren, Alphonzo Mizell and Deke Richards), "I Want You Back" was the song that put the Jackson 5, and therefore Michael Jackson, on the map: it was the Jackson 5's first major label single, in 1969, and went to No. 1 on the Billboard magazine pop chart.

Last Friday, an emailer sent me a YouTube video and an audio file of a clip from a somewhat-obscure national talk radio show. Both purported to expose shocking facts in the labyrinthine national health care legislation that has been proposed and enacted in recent years.

The audit found that the school did not record out-of-school suspensions as absences until 2011. There were instances of students who had left the school but were still being counted as present. And there is one case involving a student with a 10-day illness who was improperly withdrawn from school, then re-enrolled, so that the child would not be counted as absent. The audit states that in the 2010-11 school year, Veal told the secretary to "clean up" attendance by finding all students with five or more absences and recording those absences as tardies in the computerized system.

A Jungian psychologist encouraged Fellini to record his "night work," his dreams, and he did so assiduously from 1960 to '68 and again from 1973 to 1990. It was fertile ground. As a child, Fellini could not wait for bedtime, when he would close his eyes and see absorbing spectacles. He had named the four corners of his bed after four cinemas of Rimini, his birthplace on the Adriatic coast. True to his childhood self, he later was to regard his films as dreams on celluloid. His sketchbooks were partly a record of possible film ideas. One sketch has the worried annotation, "Have I just let a film idea escape while engaged in my usual neurotic masturbatory fantasies?"

Likewise, while Florida is no stranger to hurricanes, the one that blows through "Dolphin Tale" seems to have gathered its winds at the conference table where Karen Janszen and Noam Dromi wrote the script.

"I think it's hard to tell who's the 1 and 2 line, so it's hard to have a matchup," Hitchcock said. "They have one line that plays against top lines. We have one line that plays against top lines. They have a No. 2 line that they don't care who they play against because they're good. So I don't see it as a defined matchup. There's some individual line matchups that are going to go on, but I think it's more focus on your own team."

Some factors might have worked against him. The 1969 Cubs, an enduring symbol of failure, already had three players in the Hall: Ernie Banks, Billy Williams and Fergie Jenkins. Why should that ill-fated team be rewarded so lavishly? Some opponents did not like the way Santo ran and clicked his heels after each Cubs victory. Perhaps that played a role with previous Veterans Committee votes. But in light of some of the touchdown celebrations we see weekly, Santo's mode of celebration seems charming now.

DG: Whiting received some consideration for the club's Pitcher of the Year Award within in the Cardinals' front office. He started the year in the bullpen but emerged to be the most consistent starter for Low-A Quad Cities. Was the best prospect in that rotation? No, Carlos Martinez was to start the year and Trevor Rosenthal was to finish it. But you could call Whiting the ace of the group. He is the latest control pitcher to succeed at that level, following P.J. Walters and Trey Hearne, to name two. Folks I've spoken to believe Whiting's stuff is a tick better, and that will have to be true for him to ascend. Boone has command of three pitches, he operates in that 88-91 mph area, and he has what's advertised as a true swing-and-miss slider. That last trait will serve him well as he advances, and it does feed the notion that relief work could be in his future. Right now, he'll stay as a starter because of his mix of pitches and his ability to fit them into the edges of the strike zone. It makes sense for him to be on the same "track" as the pitchers he echoes - a steady climb through the system. Hearne had trouble in Class AA. Walters and his changeup had difficulty in the majors. Like those two, Whiting will have to master the level before moving ahead, and his first test will come in Springfield, when he gets there.

We demand to be released from the ghetto of separate-but-equal, ignored-yet-despised. Two consenting adults have the right to marry — or is this reserved only for “the faithful”? Consent is the cornerstone of marriage, so heavy it crushes unseemly allegations — and the straight Woody Allen has proved that marriages stranger and less palatable than the union of two loving men or women may still be built upon that foundation.

“I really believe that film is an art form, and hopefully if the art is good enough, you’ll want to see it more than once,” he says. “That’s what drew me to Scorsese more than anything — I’d seen his other films so many times, and each time discovered a moment I hadn’t picked up on before. That sort of complexity, that amount of detail — well, I think that’s part of what creates good movies. And those are the kind of movies I want to make. I don’t want to make something that’s just disposable.”

Tancredo said the state should roll back Medicaid eligibility to 2007 levels, something that would be prohibited by the new federal health care law. Even rolling eligibility back to levels permitted under the law might not save the state any money, because the most recent expansion in eligibility was funded by a fee paid by hospitals and then matched by federal dollars.

Electronics and entertainment companies around the world are banking on 3-D to fuel a new boom in TV, movies and games. Most 3-D TVs on the market today rely on glasses to rapidly deliver separate images to each eye, which creates a sense of three-dimensional depth.
His voice is rich, Scottish, oily and duplicitous — the snake in the Garden of Eden sounded exactly like this. Indeed, it's hard to have a phone conversation with McDiarmid without picturing him on the other end shriveled up in hatred, his eyes burning in resentment, his face cloaked inside shadows, plotting the demise of the Jedi. But as unseemly as that is — to gloss over decades of celebrated stage work and a best actor Tony (for his role alongside Ralph Fiennes in the 2006 Broadway production of "Faith Healer") — pretending McDiarmid wasn't central to"Star Wars" is no easier than pretending Paul McCartney wasn't in the Beatles.

Use all your senses: Judging beer is a science, and Pat Daniels -- one of the most knowledgeable tasters around -- offers an excellent guide: bjcp.org/docs/How_to_Judge_Beer.pdf. "All five human senses can and should be used when judging officially or casually," says Daniels, a bartender at McNulty's Bier Markt. And yes, that includes hearing: "I know what you're thinking. How can one's ears contribute to the overall beer-tasting experience? When judging or casually drinking from beer poured from the bottle, I have started the process with many styles such as a highly carbonated Belgian Gueuze and Tripel that should present the sound of massive amounts of CO2 escaping from the bottle (like popping champagne) after being opened. Unfortunately, my ears are the first to detect that such a bottle has gone flat and lost this sought-after carbonation that helps makes the style."

Let me give you an example of a case in which I think the IRS really blew it. We reported a Baptist church in northern Arkansas back in 2004 where the pastor has held a service on Independence Day. Part of the church's service even included registering voters registration (no problem with that). However, the pastor gave a sermon while flanked by two large screens. As he would start talking about an issue, photographs of George W. Bush or Sen. John Kerry would be flashed on the screen. When he said "one candidate" is fighting terrorists, a very nice official White House photo of Bush was shown; he'd then note in a mocking tone that "the other candidate believes we are not at war at all but in a lawsuit." An unflattering picture of Kerry in a crowd was shown. It went on like this for several issues. Bush was praised and Kerry was belittled.

Could school go on without blindfolds? Without butter-making projects? Of course. It also could continue without a sobbing elementary school student ever getting a reassuring hug from a teacher, another thing teachers are being instructed to avoid in the wake of Miramonte.

In situations where the lives of others depend on your ability to lead, there is no time for bickering. Experience in making life-or-death decisions while serving in the Marine Corps has given Fletcher exactly the kind of leadership experience necessary to make difficult decisions like those that San Diego faces.

Not to mention run support for guys such as Chris Volstad (0-3), who nursed a 1-1 game into the sixth inning before allowing a run-scoring double to Carlos Beltran, followed by a two-run home run to David Freese.

Turn heat down to medium and simmer for about 30 seconds until wine has evaporated. Add butter, mushrooms, yellow and green onions (can substitute chives), parsley, salt and pepper. Do not cover. Simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. If ingredients are too dry, add chicken broth or water to create a rich and creamy consistency.

Additionally, since your needs are not being met, you will likely find yourself more tense and irritable with him in the long run.

The roomful of journalists from Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa and Missouri scribbled fast as Horvit and other experienced reporters in the audience shared tips for backgrounding and deep web searches, finding information and contacts that many assumed had "disappeared" from the web, getting the most out of Illinois' open records law and other (for us!) fun stuff.

Mike Dawson, a political strategist and media consultant who was a top aide to former Sens.

The OLCC is also suggesting allowing some grocers to become liquor agents, creating stores within stores so someone can truly do one-stop shopping when it comes to getting items for an alcohol-inclusive party. Think of all the double trips made this week as people shop for their New Year's parties. The busy holiday season is a good time to get people on board with the need for changes. And in an area so aware and rightly concerned about vehicle-related pollution, it'd be surprising if there was not a wide swath of people behind the new rules for that concern alone.

Putin's decision not to go to the G-8 summit — instead sending his predecessor and now prime minister Dmitry Medvedev — was explained as necessary for Putin to form his Cabinet.

The GOP, in large part, isn't displaying its usual anti-gay election-year demagoguery, and not just in the "pledge." As recently as 1995, a Republican-controlled Congress was holding hearings investigating "homosexual recruitment" and the "promotion" of homosexuality. During the George W. Bush administration, the party used its fervent opposition to marriage for gay and lesbian couples as a get-out-the-vote strategy, encouraging more than a dozen anti-gay state ballot initiatives geared at driving turnout in the 2004 election and engineering repeated efforts to pass an amendment to the Constitution. This year is the first election year in recent history in which anti-gay rhetoric has been significantly muted: No state is facing an anti-gay initiative on the ballot, and marriage has not been a focus of the national conservative agenda.

Maybe Cooper never had to play such bad Michigan teams as Tressel does now, but, in that regard, you can't say enough about Rich Rodriguez, Carr's successor.

The challengers accept that the federal government can legitimately seek to improve access to health care. They acknowledge that states could individually adopt virtually identical plans—as Massachusetts has—and that Congress could enact even more aggressive means of promoting universal coverage, such as extending a Medicare-type single-payer system, to all Americans. They say, however, that the particular way the Affordable Care Act is structured violates an intricate constitutional framework intended to constrain federal power by channeling it through a limited set of policy options.
"We're not talking about what most people see as routine injuries," said Dr. Brendan Patterson, inaugural chair of the new network's advisory board and executive director of surgery at MetroHealth. "We're talking about people who need a highly-orchestrated, choreographed team of providers."

Sherrod Brown is complaining that U.S. Customs and Border Protection is not checking trucks for illegal loads of live U.S.-raised Asian carp destined for Canadian markets.

Because cicadas like to lay eggs in small, woody branches, mature trees will weather a cicada storm. Very young trees with trunks less than an inch in diameter are most at risk.

Weak Chicago-area manufacturing data released Monday increased the odds that the Federal Reserve will embark on a new round of bond purchases, known as quantitative easing, in order to stimulate the economy, traders and analysts said.

The Democrats in Washington knew Obamacare would never survive an open debate with sufficient time devoted to unpacking everything lurking in its 2,000-plus pages.

I'd hazard to say that most of the dudes behind the "Brokeback" mashups haven't seen the film. No matter; having parodied it, they'll want to check it out. And I have a dream, see. I dream that somewhere out in Bushland people who missed "Brokeback Mountain" in theaters, either through their own fear or their neighborhood Cineplex's refusal to show it, will feel safe ordering it from Netflix and watching it in the privacy of their shag-carpeted living rooms, sandwiched between "American Pie II" and that sanctimonious exercise in sadomasochism, "The Passion of the Christ."
